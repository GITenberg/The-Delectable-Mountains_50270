      the Mountains, to behold the Gardens, and Orchards, the Vineyards, and
      Fountains of water.... Now there was on the tops of these Mountains,
      Shepherds feeding their flocks, and they stood by the high-way side. The
      Pilgrims therefore went to them, and leaning upon their staves, (as is
      common with weary Pilgrims, when they stand to talk with any by the way,)
      they asked, Whose delectable Mountains are these?... When the Shepherds
      perceived that they were way-faring men, they also put questions to them,
      as, Whence came you? and, How got you into the way? and, By what means
      have you so persevered therein?... Then said the Shepherds one to another,
      Let us here shew to the Pilgrims the Gates of the Coelestial City, if they
      have skill to look through our Perspective Glass.... Then they essayed to
      look, but... they could not look steadily through the Glass; yet they
      thought they saw something like the Gate.

    <h2>
      THE PLACE OF THE ABANDONED GODS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he hut was built
      two sides and the roof of sodded poles; the roof had new clapboards of
      birch bark, but the rest had once belonged to a charcoal burner; the front
      side was partly poled and partly open, the back was the under-slope of a
      rock. For it stood by a cliff, one of the many that show their lonely
      faces all over the Cattle Ridge, except that this was more tumultuous than
      most, and full of caves made by the clumsy leaning bowlders; and all about
      were slim young birch trees in white and green, like the demoiselles at
      Camelot. Old pines stood above the cliff, making a soft, sad noise in the
      wind. In one of the caves above the leafage of the birches we kept the
      idols, especially Baal, whom we thought the most energetic; and in front
      of the cave was the altar-stone that served them all, a great flat rock
      and thick with moss, where ears of com were sacrificed, or peas or
      turnips, the first-fruits of the field; or of course, if you shot a
      chipmunk or a rabbit, you could have a burnt offering of that kind. Also
      the altar-stone was a council chamber and an outlook.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all a secret place on the north side of the Cattle Ridge, with
      cliffs above and cliffs below. Eastward half a mile lay the Cattle Ridge
      Road, and beyond that the Ridge ran on indefinitely; southward, three
      miles down, the road took you into Hagar; westward the Ridge, after all
      its leagues of length and rigor of form, broke down hurriedly to the
      Wyantenaug River, at a place called the Haunted Water, where stood the
      Leather Hermit's hut and beyond which were Bazilloa Armitage's
      bottom-lands and the Preston Plains railroad station. The road from the
      station across the bridge came through Sanderson Hollow, where the fields
      were all over cattle and lively horses, and met the Cattle Ridge Road to
      Hagar. And last, if you looked north from the altar-stone, you saw a long,
      downward sweep of woodland, and on and on miles and miles to the meadows
      and ploughed lands toward Wimberton, with a glimpse of the Wyantenaug far
      away to the left. Such were the surroundings of the place of abandoned
      gods. No one but ourselves came there, unless possibly the Hermit. If any
      one had come it was thought that Baal would pitch him over the cliffs in
      some manner, mystically. We got down on our hands and knees, and said, "O
      Baal!" He was painted green, on a shingle; but his eyes were red. The
      place was reached from the Cattle Ridge Road by trail, for the old
      wood-road below was grown up to blackberry brambles, which made one
      scratched and bloody and out of patience, unless it were blackberry time.
    </p>
    <p>
      And on the bank, where the trail drops into the climbing highway, there
      Aaron and Silvia were sitting in the June afternoon, hand in hand, with
      the filtered green light of the woods about them. We came up from Hagar,
      the three of us, and found them. They were strangers, so far as we knew.
      Strangers or townsmen, we never took the trail with any one in sight; it
      was an item in the Vows. But we ranged up before them and stared candidly.
      There was nothing against that. Her eyes were nice and blue, and at the
      time they contained tears. Her cheeks were dimpled and pink, her brown
      dress dusty, and her round straw hat cocked a bit over one tearful blue
      eye. He seemed like one who had been growing fast of late. His arms swung
      loosely as if fastened to his shoulders with strings. The hand that held
      her small hand was too large for its wrist, the wrist too large for the
      arm, the arm too long for the shoulder. He had the first growth of a downy
      mustache, a feeble chin, a humorous eye, and wore a broad-brimmed straw
      hat and a faded black coat, loose and flopping to his knees. A carpet bag
      lay at his feet, only half full and fallen over with an air of depression.
      He seemed depressed in the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's she crying for?" asked Moses Durfey, stolidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aaron peered around at her shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's scared to go home. I ain't, but I mote be 'fore I got there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's your name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We-ell&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated. Then, with loud defiance:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's Mr. and Mrs. Bees."
    </p>
    <p>
      A red squirrel clambered down a low-hanging branch overhead, and chattered
      sharply, scattering flakes of bark. Aaron, still holding Silvia's hand,
      leaned back on the bank and looked up. All lines of trouble faded quickly
      from his face. He smiled, so that his two front teeth stood out
      startlingly, and held up a long forefinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cherky little cuss, ain't he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The squirrel became more excited. Aaron's finger seemed to draw him like a
      loadstone. He slid down nearer and nearer, as far as the branch allowed,
      to a foot or two away, chattering his teeth fearfully. We knew that any
      one who could magnetize so flighty and malicious a person as a red
      squirrel, must be a magician, however simple he might be otherwise. Aaron
      snapped his finger and the squirrel fled. "We'd better be movin', Silvy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Silvia's tears flowed the faster, and the lines of trouble returned to
      Aaron's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't she want to go home?" persisted Moses, stolidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      We drew close beside them now and sat on the bank, Moses and I by Aaron,
      Chub Leroy by Silvia. Chub was thoughtful. Silvia dried her eyes and said
      with a gulp:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's pa."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it." Aaron nodded and rubbed his sharp nose. "Old man Kincard,
      it's him."
    </p>
    <p>
      They both looked at us trustfully. Moses saw no light in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's my father-in-law. He ain't goin' to like it. He's a sneezer. What he
      don't like generally gets out of the way. My snakes! He 'll put Silvy up
      the chimney and me in the stove, and he 'll light the fire."
    </p>
    <p>
      He chuckled and then relapsed into trouble. His emotions seemed to flit
      across his face like sunbeams and shadows on a wall, leaving no trace
      behind them, or each wiped out by the next.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Snakes! We might just as well sit here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Silvia wept again. Moses's face admitted a certain surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What'll he do that for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      While Aaron told their story, Silvia sometimes commented tearfully on his
      left, Moses stolidly on his right, and the red squirrel with excitement
      overhead; Chub and I were silent; the woods for the most part kept still
      and listened too, with only a little sympathetic murmur of leaves and
      tremble of sunbeam and shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kincard place, it seemed, lay five miles away, down the north side
      till you cleared the woods, and then eastward among the foothills. Old
      Kincard's first name was James. And directly across the road stood the
      four-roomed house where the Bees family once lived. It was "rickety now
      and rented to rats." The Bees family had always been absent-minded, given
      to dying off and leaving things lying around. In that way Aaron had begun
      early to be an orphan and to live with the Kincards. He was supposed to
      own the old house and the dooryard in front of it, but the rats never paid
      their rent, unless they paid it to the old man or the cat; and Mr. Kincard
      had a low opinion of Aaron, as being a Bees, and because he was built
      lengthwise instead of sidewise and knew more about foxes than cows. It
      seemed to Aaron that a fox was in himself a more interesting person; that
      this raising more potatoes than you could eat, more tobacco than you could
      smoke, this making butter and cheese and taking them to Wimberton weekly,
      and buying little except mortgages and bank accounts, somewhere involved a
      mistake. A mortgage was an arrangement by which you established strained
      relations with a neighbor, a bank account something that made you
      suspicious of the bank. Now in the woods one dealt for direct usefulness,
      comfort, and freedom of mind. If a man liked to collect mortgages rather
      than fox-skins, it was the virtue of the woods to teach tolerance; but Mr.
      Kincard's opinion of Aaron was low and active. There was that difference
      between a Kincard and a Bees point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aaron and Silvia grew up a few years apart on the old spread-out farm,
      with the wooded mountainside heaving on the south and stretching east and
      west. It was a neighborhood of few neighbors, and no village within many
      miles, and the old man was not talkative commonly, though he'd open up
      sometimes. Aaron and Silvia had always classed themselves together in
      subdued opposition to their grim ruler of destiny. To each other they
      called him "the old man," and expressed by it a reverential but opposed
      state of mind. To Aaron the undoubted parts of life were the mountain-side
      of his pleasures and the level fields of his toil. Wimberton was but a
      troubled glimpse now and then, an improbable memory of more people and
      houses than seemed natural. Silvia tended to see things first through
      Aaron's eyes, though she kept a basal judgment of her own in reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He always licked us together since we was little," said Aaron, looking at
      Silvia with softly reminiscent eye. "It was two licks to me for Silvy's
      one. That was square enough, and the old man thought so. When he got set
      in a habit he'd never change. It was two to me for Silvy's one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aaron told him, but a week now gone, that himself and Silvia would wish to
      be married, and he seemed surprised. In fact he came at Aaron with the
      hoe-handle, but could not catch him, any more than a lonesome rabbit. Then
      he opened up astonishingly, and told Aaron of his low opinion of him,
      which was more spread-out and full of details than you'd expect. He wasn't
      going to give Aaron any such "holt on him as that," with a guaranty deed,
      whatever that was, on eternity to loaf in, and he set him the end of the
      week to clear out, to go elsewhere forever. To Aaron's mind that was an
      absurd proposal. He wasn't going to do any such foolishness. The rather he
      sold his collection of skins to a farmer named Shore, and one morning
      borrowed a carpet bag and came over the Cattle Ridge hand in hand with
      Silvia.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Preston Plains they hired a team, drove over the line into York
      State, and were married. The farmer named Shore laid that out for them. He
      had a back score of trouble with the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Silvy's got a cat," added Aaron, "and she catches rats to please
      herself. Silvy thinks she ought to catch rats to be obligin'. Folks that
      live up these trees don't act that way. No more did Shore."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Aaron looked shrewd and wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish Sammy was here," murmured Silvia, lovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "First-rate cat," Aaron admitted. "Now, we didn't marry to oblige each
      other. Each of us obliged himself. Hey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Silvia opened her eyes wide. The idea seemed a little complicated. They
      clasped hands the tighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," said Aaron, "Silvy's scared. I ain't, but I mote be when I got
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      A blue-jay flew shrieking down the road. Aaron looked after it with a
      quick change of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See him! Yes, sir. You can tell his meanness the way he hollers. Musses
      folks' eggs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aaron no longer surprised us now, nor did Silvia. We accepted them. We had
      standards of character and conduct, of wisdom and of things possible, but
      they were not set for us by the pulpit, the statute book, or the
      market-place. We had often gone forth on expeditions into the mystical
      beyond, always with a certain purpose to achieve there, and at some point
      it had been necessary to come home and face the punishment, if there were
      any, to have supper, and go to bed. Home could not be left permanently and
      another existence arranged, any more than the feet could be taken from the
      earth permanently. It had been found impractical. Aaron and Silvia were
      like ourselves. They might conceive of living away from the farmhouse
      under the mountain-side a few days. They shrank from facing old Kincard
      with his hoe-handle or horse-whip, but one must go back eventually. We
      recognized that their adventure was bold and peculiar; we judged the price
      likely to be appalling; we gave them frank admiration for both. None of us
      had ever run away to be definitely married, or suffered from a hoe-handle
      or a horse-whip, and yet all these were things to be conceived of and
      sympathized with.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew a blue-jay," went on Aaron, thoughtfully, "that lived near the end
      of Shore's land, and he never appeared to like anything agreeable. He used
      to hang around other folks' nests and holler till they were distracted."
    </p>
    <p>
      Silvia's snuffling caught his ear, and once more the rapid change passed
      over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We-ell," he said, "the old man'll be lively, that's sure. I'd stay in the
      woods, if it was me, but women"&mdash;with a large air of observation&mdash;"have
      to have houses.".
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've got a house," broke in Chub, suddenly. We exchanged looks
      furtively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They'll have to take the Vows," I objected. "We've took 'em," said Aaron.
      "Parson&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll have to solemn swear," said Moses. "Will you solemn swear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if you tell, you hope you drop dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      The blue-jay flew up the road again, shrieking scornfully. The red
      squirrel trembled and chattered his teeth on the branch overhead. All else
      in the woods was silent while Aaron and Silvia took the Vows.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so we brought them, in excitement and content, to the place of the
      abandoned gods. Baal lurked far back in his cave, the cliff looked down
      with lonely forehead, the distant prospect was smooth and smoky. Neither
      the gods nor the face of the world offered any promise or threat. But
      Aaron and Silvia seemed to believe in the kindness of not human things.
      Silvia fell to chattering, laughing, in unforeboding relief from sudden
      and near-by evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aaron had a surprising number of silver dollars, due to Shore and the
      fox-skins, by means of which we should bring them supplies from Hagar; and
      so we left them to the whispering gossip of leaves, the lonely cliff, the
      lurking Baal, and the smooth, smoky prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt there were times to Aaron and Silvia of trembling awe, dumb
      delight, conversations not to the point, so that it seemed more successful
      merely to sit hand in hand and let the moon speak for them, pouring light
      down silvery gulfs out of the abundant glory within her. There could be
      seen, too, the dawn, as pink as Silvia's cheeks, but, after all, not so
      interesting. A hermit-thrush sang of things holy at dawn, far down the
      woodland, while the birch leaves trembled delicately and the breeze was
      the sigh of a world in love; and of things quietly infinite at sunset in
      the growth of rosy gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's nice," Silvia might whisper, leaning to Aaron.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a hermit-thrush down there, Silvy. He opens his mouth, and oh!
      Kingdom's comin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Little brown chap with a scared eye. You don't ever see him hardly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't want to, do you, Aaron?" after a long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't know as you do."
    </p>
    <p>
      There would be a tendency, at least, to look at things that way, and talk
      duskily as the dusk came on, and we would leave them on the altar-stone to
      take the trail below.
    </p>
    <p>
      But early in the afternoon it would be lively enough, except that Silvia
      had a prejudice against Baal, which might have been dangerous if Baal had
      minded it; but he did her no harm. She referred to Elijah and those
      prophets of Baal, and we admitted he had been downed that time, for it
      took him when he was not ready, and generally he was low in his luck ever
      since. But we had chosen him first for an exiled dignity, who must needs
      have a deadly dislike for the other dignity who had once conquered him
      vaingloriously, and so must be in opposition to much that we opposed, such
      as Sunday-school lessons, sermons, and limitations of liberty. It might be
      that our reasonings were not so concrete and determined, but the sense of
      opposition was strong. We put it to Silvia that she ought to respect
      people's feelings, and she was reasonable enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Kincard, it seemed, was an interesting and opinionated heathen, and
      Silvia had not experienced sermons and Sunday-schools. That explained
      much. But she had read the Bible, which her mother had owned, before she
      died; and we could follow her there, knowing it to be a book of naturally
      strong points, as respects David for instance, Joseph, and parts of
      Revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aaron did not care for books, and had no prejudice toward any being or
      supposition that might find place in the woods. The altar-stone was common
      to many gods and councils, and we offered it to Silvia, to use as she
      liked. I judge she used it mostly to sit there with Aaron, and hear the
      hermit-thrush, or watch the thick moonlight pour down the scoop of the
      mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      That stretch of the Wyantenaug which is called the Haunted Water is quiet
      and of slow current, by reason of its depth, and dark in color, by reason
      of the steep fall of the Cattle Ridge and the pines which crowd from it to
      the water's edge. The Leather Hermit's hut stood up from the water in the
      dusk of the pines.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to the valley in times within the memories of many who would speak
      if they were asked, but long enough ago to have become a settled fact; and
      if any did not like him, neither did they like the Wyantenaug to flood the
      bottom-lands in spring. The pines and the cliffs belonged to the
      Sandersons, who cared little enough for either phenomenon.
    </p>
    <p>
      We often met him on the Cattle Ridge, saw him pass glowering through the
      thicket with shaggy gray beard and streaming hair. Sometimes he wore a
      horse-blanket over his leathern vestment. He was apt to be there Sundays,
      wandering about, and maybe trying to make out in what respect he differed
      from Elijah the Tishbite; and although we knew this, and knew it was in
      him to cut up roughly if he found out about Baal, being a prophet himself
      both in his looks and his way of acting, still he went to and fro for the
      most part on the other side of the crest, where he had a trail of his own;
      and you could not see the altar-stone from the top of the cliff, but had
      to climb down till you came to a jam of bowlders directly over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We did not know how long he may have stood there, glowering down on us.
      The smoke of the sacrifice was beginning to curl up. Baal was backed
      against a stone, looking off into anywhere and taking things
      indifferently. Silvia sat aside, twirled her hat scornfully, and said we
      were "silly." Aaron chewed a birch twig, and was very calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got down on our hands and knees, and said, "O Baal!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Hermit's voice broke over us in thunder and a sound as of falling
      mountains. It was Sunday, June 26, 1875.
    </p>
    <p>
      He denounced us under the heads of "idolaters, gone after the abornination
      of the Assyrians; babes and sucklings, old in sin, setting up strange gods
      in secret places; idle mockers of holy things, like the little children of
      Bethel, whereby they were cursed of the prophet and swallowed of
      she-bears"; three headings with subdivisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he came down thumping on the left. Silvia shrieked and clung to
      Aaron, and we fled to the right and hid in the rocks. He fell upon Baal,
      cast him on the altar-fire, stamping both to extinction, and shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know you, Aaron Bees and Silvia Kincard!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "N-no, you don't," stammered Aaron. "It's Mrs. Bees."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hermit stood still and glared on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why are you here, Aaron and Silvia Bees?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Aaron recovered himself, and fell to chewing his birch twig.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We-ell, you see, it's the old man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What of him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'd lick us with a hoe-handle, wouldn't he? And maybe he'd throw us out,
      after all. What'd be the use? Might as well stay away," Aaron finished,
      grumbling. "Save the hoe."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hermit's glare relaxed. Some recollection of former times may have
      passed through his rifted mind, or the scent of a new denunciation drawn
      it away from the abornination of Assyria, who lay split and smoking in the
      ashes. He leaped from the altar-stone, and vanished under the leafage of
      the birches. We listened to him crashing and plunging, chanting something
      incoherent and tuneless, down the mountain, till the sound died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas, Baal-Peor! Even to this day there are twinges of shame, misgivings
      of conscience, that we had fled in fear and given him over to his enemy,
      to be trampled on, destroyed and split through his green jacket and red
      eye. He never again stood gazing off into anywhere, snuffing the fumes of
      sacrifice and remembering Babylon. The look of things has changed since
      then. We have doubted Baal, and-found some restraints of liberty more
      grateful than tyrannous. But it is plain that in his last defeat Baal-Peor
      did not have a fair chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning the Hermit's progress from this point, I can only draw upon
      guesses and after report. He struck slantingwise down the mountain, left
      the woods about at the Kincard place, and crossed the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Kincard sat in his doorway smoking his pipe, thick-set, deep-chested,
      long-armed, with square, rough-shaven jaws, and steel-blue eyes looking
      out of a face like a carved cliff for length and edge. The Hermit stood
      suddenly before and denounced him under two heads&mdash;as a heathen
      unsoftened in heart, and for setting up the altar of lucre and pride
      against the will of the Lord that the children of men should marry and
      multiply. Old Kincard took his pipe from his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where might them marriers and multipliers be just now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hermit pointed to the most westward cliff in sight from the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you have not in mind to repent, James Kincard, I shall know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe you'd put them ideas of yours again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hermit restated his position accurately on the subject of heathen
      hearts and the altar of lucre.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ain't no mistake about that, Hermit? We-ell, now&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hermit shook his head sternly, and strode away. Old Kincard gave a
      subterranean chuckle, such as a volcano might give purposing eruptions,
      and fixed his eyes on the western cliff, five miles away, a grayish spot
      in the darker woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas, Baal-Peor!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he was never indeed a wood-god. He was always remembering how fine it
      had been in Babylon. He had not cared for these later devotions. He had
      been bored and weary. Since he was gone, split and dead, perhaps it was
      better so. He should have a funeral pyre.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And," said Chub Leroy, "we'll keep his ashes in an urn. That's the way
      they always did with people's ashes."
    </p>
    <p>
      We came up the Cattle Ridge Road Monday afternoon, talking of these
      things. Chub carried the urn, which had once been a pickle-jar. Life still
      was full of hope and ideas. The Hermit must be laid low in his arrogance.
      Apollo, now, had strong points. Consider the pythoness and the oracle. The
      Hermit couldn't prophesy in the same class with a pythoness. The oracle
      might run,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "He who dwells by the Haunted Water alone,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He shall not remain, but shall perish."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      We came then to the hut, but Silvia would have, nothing to do with Baal's
      funeral, so that she and Aaron wandered away among the birches, that were
      no older than they, young birches, slim and white, coloring the sunlight
      pale green with their leaves. And we went up to the altar-stone, and made
      ready the funeral, and set the urn to receive the ashes, decently, in
      order. The pyre was built four-square, of chosen sticks. We did not try to
      fit Baal together much; we laid him on as he came. And when the birch bark
      was curling up and the pitchy black smoke of it was pouring upward, we
      fell on our faces and cried: "Alas, Baal! Woe's me, Baal!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a good ceremony. For when you are doing a ceremony, it depends on
      how much your feelings are worked up, of course, and very few, if any, of
      those we had done&mdash;and they were many&mdash;had ever reached such a
      point of efficiency as the funeral of Baal-Peor. Moses howled mournfully,
      as if it were in some tooth that his sorrow lay. The thought of that
      impressiveness and luxury of feeling lay mellow in our minds long after.
      "Alas, Baal!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody snorted near by. We looked up. Over our heads, thrust out beyond
      the edge of the bowlders, was a strange old face, with heavy brows and
      jaws and grizzled hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The face was distorted, the jaws working. It disappeared, and we sat up,
      gasping at one another across the funeral pyre, where the black smoke was
      rolling up faster and faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment the face came out on the altar-stone, and looked at us with
      level brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What ye doin'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My goodness!" gasped Moses. "You aren't another hermit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What ye doin'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Chub recovered himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's Baal's funeral."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down on a stone and wiped his face, which was heated. He carried a
      notable stick in his hand. "Baal! We-ell, what ailed him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you Silvia's old man?" asked Chub.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so&mdash;er&mdash;what ailed Baal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we told him&mdash;seeing Baal was dead and the Vows would have to be
      taken over again&mdash;we told him about Baal, and about the Leather
      Hermit, because he seemed touched by it, and worked his face and blinked
      his sharp hard eyes uncannily. Some hidden vein of grim ideas was coming
      to a white heat within him, like a suppressed molten stratum beneath the
      earth, unsuspected on its surface, that suddenly heaves and cracks the
      faces of stone cliffs. He gave way at last, and his laughter was the
      rending tumult of an earthquake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aaron and Silvia came up through the woods hastily to the altar-stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say," cried Chub. "Are you going to lick them? It's two to Aaron for
      one to Silvia."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Been marryin' and multiplying have ye?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He suppressed the earthquake, but still seemed mainly interested in Baal's
      funeral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aaron said, "She's Mrs. Bees, anyhow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so. Baal's dead. That hermit's some lively."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll get an oracle on him," said Moses. "What you going to do to Aaron
      and Silvia?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Silvia cast herself on the old man suddenly and wept on his shoulder.
      One often noticed how girls would start up and cry on a person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe the earthquake had brought up subsoils and mellowed things; at least
      Kincard made no motion to lick some one, though he looked bored, as any
      fellow might.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, we-ell, I don't know&mdash;er&mdash;what's that oracle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "He who dwells hy the Haunted Water alone,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He shall not remain, but shall perish."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's going to be like that," said Chub. "Won't it fetch him, don't you
      think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It ought to," said the old man, working his jaw. "It ought to."
    </p>
    <p>
      The black smoke had ceased, and flames were crackling and dancing all over
      the funeral pyre. The clearer smoke floated up against the face of the
      lonesome cliff. Aaron and Silvia clasped hands unfrightened. The old man
      now and then rumbled subterraneously in his throat. Peace was everywhere,
      and presently Baal-Peor was ashes.

      THE LEATHER HERMIT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>o know the
      Wyantenaug thoroughly is to be wise in rivers; which if any one doubts,
      let him follow it from its springs to the sea&mdash;a possible fortnight&mdash;and
      consider then how he is a changed man with respect to rivers. Not that by
      any means it is the epitome of rivers. It is no spendthrift flood-stream
      to be whirling over the bottom-lands in April and scarcely able to wet its
      middle stones in August, but a shrewd and honest river, a canny river
      flowing among a canny folk, a companionable river, loving both laughter
      and sentiment, with a taste for the varieties of life and a fine vein of
      humor. Observe how it dances and sputters down the rapids&mdash;not really
      losing its temper, but pretending to be nervous&mdash;dives into that
      sloping pass where the rocks hang high and drip forever, runs through it
      like a sleuth-hound, darkly and savagely, and saunters out into the
      sunlight, as who should say in a guileless manner, "You don't happen to
      know where I'm going?" Then it wanders about the valley, spreads out
      comfortably and lies quiet a space, "But it really makes no difference,
      you know"; and after that gives a chuckle, rounds a bunch of hills and
      goes scampering off, quite taken up with a new idea. And so in many ways
      it is an entertaining and friendly river, with a liking for a joke and a
      pretty notion of dramatic effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, of all times and places, I think it most beautiful in the twilight
      and along that stretch, called of late the Haunted Water, opposite the
      village of Preston Plains. The Cattle Ridge with its long heaving spine
      comes down on the valley from the east, seeming to have it very much in
      mind to walk over and do something to Preston Plains three miles beyond;
      but it thought better of that long ago. The Wyantenaug goes close beneath
      it in sheer bravado: "You try to cross me and you get jolly wet"; for the
      Wyantenaug is very deep and broad just here. The Cattle Ridge, therefore,
      merely wrinkles its craggy brows with a puzzled air, and Preston Plains is
      untroubled save of its own inhabitants. As to that matter the people of
      the village of Hagar have opinions. The valley road goes on the other side
      of the river&mdash;naturally, for there are the pastures, the feeding
      cattle, the corn-fields, and farmhouses&mdash;and the Cattle Ridge side is
      steep, and threaded by a footpath only, for a mile or more, up to Hants
      Corby's place. Hants Corby's is not much of a place either.
    </p>
    <p>
      In old times the footpath was seldom used, except by the Leather Hermit.
      No boy in Hagar would go that way for his life, though we often went up
      and down on the river, and saw the Leather Hermit fishing. The minister in
      Hagar visited him once or twice, and probably went by the footpath. I
      remember distinctly how he shook his head and said that the Hermit sought
      salvation at any rate by a narrow way, and how the miller's wife
      remonstrated with him for seeming to take the Hermit seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mean to say he ain't crazy," she said, in anxious defence of
      standard reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I suppose so, yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister sighed and rubbed his chin uneasily, and Mrs. Mather
      recovered her ordinary state of mind, which was a state of suppressed
      complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was saying that the footpath was seldom used. Hants Corby would have
      used it&mdash;for he was too shiftless to be afraid&mdash;if the river had
      run the other way. As it was, he preferred to drift down in his boat and
      row back when he had to. He found that easier, being very shiftless. The
      Hermit himself went on the river, except in the spring when the current
      below was too strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opinions of the Leather Hermit may be shown in this way. If you came
      on him, no matter suddenly, and asked whose land that was across the
      river, he would answer promptly, "The devil's"; whereas it belonged to
      Bazilloa Armitage, a pillar of the church in Preston Plains, who
      quarrelled zealously with the other pillars; so that, as one sees, the
      Leather Hermit was not in sympathy with the church in Preston Plains.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people of the valley differed about him according to humor, and he
      used strong language regarding the people of the valley according to
      opportunity, especially regarding Bazilloa Armitage. He denounced Bazilloa
      Armitage publicly in Preston Plains as a hypocrite, a backbiter, and a man
      with a muck rake&mdash;with other language stronger still. Bazilloa
      Armitage felt hurt, for he was, in fact, rather close, and exceedingly
      respectable. Besides it is painful to be damned by a man who means exactly
      what he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      To speak particularly, this was in the year 1875; for the next year we
      camped near the spot, and Hants Corby tried to frighten us into seeing the
      Hermit's ghost. Bazilloa Armitage was denounced in June, and Hants Corby
      on the second Friday in August, as Hants and the Hermit fished near each
      other on the river. The Hermit denounced him under three heads&mdash;sluggard,
      scoffer, and beast wallowing in the sty of his own lustful contentment. On
      Saturday the Hermit rowed up to Hants Corby's place in the rain and
      denounced him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday morning the Hermit rose early, turned his back on the Wyantenaug,
      and climbed the cliff, onward and up through the pines. The prophets of
      old went into high places when they prayed; and it was an idea of his that
      those who would walk in the rugged path after them could do no better.
      Possibly the day was an anniversary, for it was of an August day many
      years gone&mdash;before ever a charcoal pit was built on the Cattle Ridge&mdash;that
      the Hermit first appeared on the Wyantenaug, with his leather clothes in a
      bundle on his back, and perhaps another and invisible burden beneath it. A
      third burden he took up immediately, that of denouncing the sins of
      Wyantenaug Valley, as I have said.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that Sabbath day the river went its way, and late in the afternoon the
      sunlight stretched a thin finger beneath the hemlocks almost to the
      Hermit's door. Across the river the two children of Bazilloa Armitage, boy
      and girl, came down to the water's edge. The boy pulled a pole and line
      out of some mysterious place in the bank. The little girl sat primly on
      the grass, mindful of her white pinafore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You better look out, Cis," he said. "Any fish you catch on Sunday is
      devils. You don't touch him. You cut the line and let him dry till
      Monday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Tad!" gasped the little girl, "won't the Leather Hermit tell?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Tad, sturdily, "father said he'd get even, if it took a month
      of Sundays, and that's six Sundays by this time. There ain't anything
      bothers the Hermit like catching the fish on Sundays, specially if you
      catch a lot of 'em. Blamed old fool!" grumbled Tad.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Tad," gasped the little girl again, in awed admiration, "that's
      swearing."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Tad did not mind. "There's Hants Corby," he exclaimed; "he's going to
      fish, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hants Corby floated down in his old boat, dropped anchor opposite the
      children, and grinned sociably.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He daren't touch his boat to-day," he said in a husky whisper. "He'll
      raise jinks in a minute. You wait."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fishes is devils on Sunday, aren't they, Hants?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trout," returned Hants, decisively, "is devils any time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Tad Armitage and Hants Corby ought to have known that the Leather
      Hermit sometimes went up the Cattle Ridge on Sundays to wrestle with an
      angel, like Jacob, who had his thigh broken. We knew that much in Hagar&mdash;and
      it shows what comes of living in Preston Plains instead of Hagar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hants Corby motioned with his thumb toward the Hermit's hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Him," he remarked, "he don't let folks alone. He wants folks to let him
      alone particular. That ain't reasonable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father says he's a fernatic," ventured Tad. "What's a fernatic, Hants?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Hants, thoughtfully, "that's a rattlin' good word."
    </p>
    <p>
      Time dragged on, and yet no denouncing voice came from the further shore.
      The door of the hut was a darker hole in the shade of the hemlocks. Hants
      Corby proposed going over to investigate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he ain't there, we'll carry off his boat."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tad fell into Hants's boat quite absorbed in the greatness of the thought.
      It was not a good thing generally to follow Hants Corby, who was an
      irresponsible person, apt to take much trouble to arrange a bad joke and
      shiftlessly slip out from under the consequences. If he left you in a
      trap, he thought that a part of the joke, as I remember very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A-a-a-ow!" wailed Cissy Armitage from the bank; for it dawned on her that
      something tremendous was going forward, in which Tad was likely to be
      suddenly obliterated. She sat on the bank with her stubby shoes hanging
      over, staring with great frightened blue eyes, till she saw them at last
      draw silently away from the further shore&mdash;and behold, the Hermit's
      boat was in tow. Then she knew that there was no one in the world so brave
      or so grandly wicked as Tad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cissy Armitage used to have fluffy yellow hair and scratches on her shins.
      She was a sunny little soul generally, but she had a way of imagining how
      badly other people felt, which interfered with her happiness, and was not
      always accurate. Tad seldom felt so badly as she thought he did. Tad
      thought he could imagine most things better on the whole, but when it came
      to imagining how badly other people felt, he admitted that she did it very
      well. Therefore when she set about imagining how the Hermit felt, on the
      other side of the river, with no boat to come across in, to where people
      were cosy and comfortable, where they sang the Doxology and put the
      kittens to bed, she quite forgot that the Hermit had always before had a
      boat, that he never yet had taken advantage of it to make the acquaintance
      of the Doxology or the kittens, and imagined him feeling very badly
      indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bazilloa Armitage held family prayers at six o'clock on Sunday afternoons;
      and all through them Cissy considered the Hermit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I sink in deep waters," read Bazilloa Armitage with a rising inflection.
      "The billows go over my head, all his waves go over me, Selah," and Cissy
      in her mind saw the Hermit sitting on the further shore, feeling very
      badly, calling Tad an "evil generation," and saying: "The billows go over
      my head, Selah," because he had no boat. She thought that one must feel
      desperately in order to say: "Selah, the billows go over me." And while
      Bazilloa Armitage prayed for the President, Congress, the Governor, and
      other people who were in trouble, she plotted diligently how it might be
      avoided that the Hermit should feel so badly as to say "Selah," or call
      Tad an "evil generation"; how she might get the boat back, in order that
      the Hermit should feel better and let bygones be; and how it might be done
      secretly, in order that Tad should not make a bear of himself. Afterwards
      she walked out of the back door in her sturdy fashion, and no one paid her
      any attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hermit muttered in the dusk of his doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leather clothes are stiff after a rain and bad for the temper; moreover,
      other things than disordered visions of the heavens rolling away as a
      scroll and the imperative duty of denouncing some one were present in his
      clouded brain,&mdash;half memories, breaking through clouds, of a time
      when he had not as yet begun to companion daily with judgment to come, nor
      had those black spots begun to dance before his eyes, which black spots
      were evidently the sins of the world. He muttered and shifted his position
      uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was once a little white house somewhere in the suburbs of a city. It
      stood near the end of a half-built street, with a sandy road in front.
      There was a child, too, that rolled its doll down the steps, rolled after
      it, wept aloud and laughed through its tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stiff leather rasped the Hermit's skin. The clouds closed in again; he
      shook himself, and raised his voice threateningly in words familiar enough
      to the denounced people of the Wyantenaug: "It is written, 'Thou shalt
      have no other gods before me'; and your gods are multitudes." He stared
      with dazed eyes across the dusky river. The little ripples chuckled,
      sobbed and gurgled in a soft, human way. Something seemed to steal in upon
      him, like a gentle hand, pleading and caressing. He made an angry motion
      to thrust it away, and muttered: "Judgment to come&mdash;judgment to
      come." He seemed to hear a sobbing and whispering, and then two infinite
      things came together in his shattered brain with a crash, leaving him
      stunned and still.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a syringa bush before the little white house, a picket fence,
      too, white and neat. Who was it that when he would cry, "Judgment to
      come!" would whisper and sob? That was not a child. That was&mdash;no&mdash;well,
      there was a child. Evidently it rolled its doll down the steps and rolled
      after it. There was a tan-yard, too, and the dressing of hides. He dressed
      hides across a bench. The other men did not take much interest in judgment
      to come. They swore at him and burned sulphur under his bench. After that
      the child rolled its doll down the steps again, and bumped after it
      pitifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hermit groaned and hid his face. He could almost remember it all, if
      it were not for the black spots, the sins of the world. Something surely
      was true&mdash;whether judgment to come or the child bumping down the
      steps he could not tell, but he thought, "Presently I shall forget one of
      the two."
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had set, and the dusk was creeping from the irregular hills
      beyond, over the village of Preston Plains, over the house of Bazilloa
      Armitage. Dark storm-clouds were bearing down from the north. A glitter
      sprang once more into the Hermit's eyes, and he welcomed the clouds,
      stretching out his hands toward them. Suddenly he dropped his hands, and
      the glitter died out in a dull stare. Across the last red reflection of
      the water glided a boat, his own boat, or one like it. A little child in
      white rose up and stood in the prow, and, as though she were a spirit, the
      light in the west passed into her hair. It was not the right way for
      judgment to come. The dark clouds bearing down from the north&mdash;that
      was judgment to come; but the spirit in the boat, that&mdash;could not be
      anything&mdash;it was false&mdash;unless&mdash;unless it rolled down the
      steps. And then once more the two infinite things came together with a
      crash. He leaped to his feet; for a moment his hands went to and fro over
      his head; he babbled mere sounds, and fell forward on his face, groaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cissy Armitage achieved the top of the bank with difficulty, and adjusted
      her pinafore. The Hermit lay on his face very still. It was embarrassing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I brought back your boat, so you needn't feel bad. I&mdash;I feel
      bad."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, hearing the Hermit moan once softly, and then for a time the
      only sound was the lapping of the water. It was growing quite dark. She
      thought that he must feel even worse than she had imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry. It's awful lonesome. I&mdash;want to go home."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hermit made no motion. Cissy felt that it was a bad case. She twisted
      her pinafore and blinked hard. The lumps were rising in her throat, and
      she did not know what to say that would show the Hermit how badly she felt&mdash;unless
      she said "Selah." It was strong language, but she ventured it at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel awful bad. The&mdash;the billows go over my head, Selah!" Then she
      wished that she had let "Selah" quite alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hermit lifted his face. It was very white; his eyes were fixed and
      dead-looking, and he got his feet under him, as if he intended to creep
      forward. Cissy backed against a tree, swallowed lumps very fast, and
      decided to kick if he came near. But he only looked at her steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your name?" he said in a slow, plaintive tone, as a man speaks
      who cannot hear his own voice. Cissy thought it silly that he should not
      know her name, having seen her often enough,&mdash;and this gave her
      courage. "Cecilia Armitage. I want to go home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" shouted the Hermit. He sat up suddenly and glared at her, so that
      the lumps began climbing her throat again faster than ever. "That isn't
      the name." Then he dropped his head between his knees and began sobbing.
      Cissy did not know that men ever cried. It seemed to tear him up, and was
      much worse than "The billows go over me, Selah." On the whole there seemed
      to be no point in staying longer. She walked to the bank and there
      hesitated diffidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to go home. I&mdash;I want you to row me."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence; the Hermit's head was still hidden between his
      knees. Then he came over and got into the boat, not walking upright, but
      almost creeping, making no noise, nor lifting his head. He took the oars
      and rowed, still keeping his head down, until the boat came under the old
      willow, where the bank runs low on the edge of Bazilloa Armitage's
      ten-acre lot. It struck the bank, but he sat still, with his head down.
      Cissy Armitage scrambled up the roots of the willow, looked back, and saw
      him sitting with his head down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cissy Armitage was the last to see the Leather Hermit alive, for Hants
      Corby found him Monday afternoon in shallow water, about a rod from shore.
      The anchor stone was clasped in his arms, and the anchor rope wound around
      his waist, which would seem to imply that he was there with a purpose. If
      that purpose was to discover which of two things were true&mdash;judgment
      to come, or the child that rolled its doll down the steps&mdash;every one
      is surely entitled to an opinion on its success or failure. There was a
      copy-book, such as children use, found in his hut. On the cover was
      written, "The Book of Judgment." It contained the record of his
      denunciations, with other odd things. The people of Wyantenaug Valley
      still differ, according to humor; but any one of them will give his or her
      opinion, if you ask it.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n those days I
      knew Hamilton only by the light in the south; for in Hagar men said, "That
      light in the south is Hamilton," as they would say, "The sunrise in the
      east, the sunset in the west, the aurora in the north," illuminations that
      were native in their places. Hamilton was a yellow glimmer on clear
      nights, and on cloudy nights a larger glow. It crouched low in the sky,
      pale, secret, enticing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also I knew that Hamilton was twenty miles away, like Sheridan's ride. How
      great and full of palaces and splendors that must be which shone so far!
      How golden its streets, and jewelled its gates, like the Celestial City,
      which is described in Revelations and "The Progress" in an unmistakable
      manner, if not as one would wish in the matter of some details. Yet to
      speak justly, "The Progress" was considered a passable good story, though
      not up to the "Arabian Nights"; and Revelations had its points, though any
      one could see the writer was mixed in his mind, and upset probably by the
      oddness of his adventures, and rather stumped how to relate them plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this story does not include the city of Hamilton, although touching on
      the lights in the south. It left its mark upon me and cast a shadow over
      many things that did not seem connected with it, being a kind of
      introduction for me to what might be called the Greater Melancholies.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are four roads that meet in Hagar: the Cattle Ridge, the Salem, the
      Windless Mountain, and the Red Rock. The Salem is broad, level, and
      straight; the Windless sweeps around the mountain, deep through the pines,
      the jungle of other woods, and the gorge of the falling Mill Stream; the
      Red Rock is a high, clean hill road, open and bare; the Cattle Ridge Road
      comes down from highest of all, from far up on the windy brows of the
      Ridge, and dips and courtesies all the way into Hagar. Some time I would
      like to make more plain the nature and influence of the Four Roads. But
      the adventure began on the Cattle Ridge Road with a wide-armed chestnut
      tree, where certain red squirrels lived who were lively and had thin
      tails. I went out over the road on a long limb with Moses Durfey and Chub
      Leroy, seeing Mr. Cummings driving a load of hay down from the Cattle
      Ridge: it seemed desirable to drop on the hay when it passed beneath. Mr.
      Cummings was sleepy. He sat nodding far down in front, while we lit softly
      on the crest and slid over behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      And next you are to know that Chub Leroy's feet came down thump on the
      head of a monstrous man, half buried in the hay, who sat up and looked
      around, vast, shaggy, black-bearded, smoking a corncob pipe, composed, and
      quite ragged in his clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph!" he said mildly, and rubbed his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few moments looking us over, he pointed with his thumb through the
      hay at Mr. Cummings, and leaned toward us and winked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Same as me," he whispered, and shook all over his fatness, silently, with
      the laughter and pleasure he was having inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a good thing in this world to have adventures, and it is only a
      matter of looking around a bit in country or city. For each fellow his
      quest is waiting at the street corner, or hides in the edge of the woods,
      peering out of green shadows. On all highways it is to be met with and is
      seldom far to seek&mdash;though no harm if it were&mdash;because the world
      is populous with men and animals, and no moment like another. It may be,
      if you drop on a hay-load, you will have a row with the driver, or you
      will thump on the head such a free traveller as ours, vast, shaggy,
      primeval, pipe-smoking, of wonderful fatness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed a sleepy, contented man, not in point of fact minding thumps on
      the head. The hay-cart rolled on gently in the dust. Mr. Cummings drowsed
      in front, unaware, and the Free Traveller drowsed behind, smoking
      listlessly. The rest of us grew sleepy too and liked everything. For it
      was odd but pleasant in a way to look down from the secrecy of the hay on
      familiar things, on the village dooryards and the tops of hats. We seemed
      to fall into silent league with the Free Traveller, to be interested in
      things, but not anxious, observing the hats of labor and ambition,
      careless of appearance, primitive, easy, seeing little importance in where
      the cart might go, because anywhere was good enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of turning east at the cross-roads, Mr. Cummings drove drowsily
      ahead on the Windless Road, although the Cummings place is east on the
      Salem; so that the hay was plainly going to the little pasture barn, three
      miles off, all one to us, and better for the Free Traveller, as it
      appeared after. But he was not interested then, being in a fair way to
      sleep. We lay deep in the hay and looked up at the blue of the sky and the
      white of the creeping clouds, till the pine trees closed suddenly over the
      road, the cliffs of Windless Mountain on one side and the Mill Stream on
      the other, deep under its bank. A strong south wind came under the pines,
      skirting the corner of the mountain, hissed through the pine needles, and
      rumpled the hay.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was a great smoke and blaze about us. "Humph!" said the Free
      Traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went off the back of the hay-cart into the middle of the road, and we
      too fell off immediately, each in his own way, on the pine needles. Mr.
      Cummings came up over the top of the load with a tumult of mixed language,
      and the horses ran away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great load sped down the green avenue smoking, crackling, blazing,
      taking with it Mr. Cummings to unknown results, and leaving the Free
      Traveller sitting up in the middle of the road and looking after it
      mildly. He heaved himself up puffing. "There!" he said. "There goes my
      pipe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all your fault," shouted Moses Durfey. "You shouldn't smoke on
      hay-loads."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe Mr. Cummings is a deader," said Chub Leroy, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Free Traveller rubbed his leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're same as me. If he ain't dead he'll come back with a strap and lam
      some of us. That ain't me. I'm going to light out."
    </p>
    <p>
      He slid under the rail and down the bank to the stream, handling himself
      wonderfully for so weighty a man; for he seemed to accommodate himself to
      obstacles like a jellyfish, and somehow to get around them. So he was over
      the bowlders and across the stream, which there divides Windless Mountain
      from the Great South Woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were indignant that he should leave us to be "lammed" for his
      carelessness. We shouted after, and Moses Durfey said he was a "chump."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might come along," retorted the Free Traveller with an injured
      manner. "What's hindering? I lugs nobody. I lets folks alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was at the wood's edge by this time, where a dim green path went in,
      looked over his shoulder a moment, and then disappeared. We scrambled down
      the bank and over the bowlders, for it was not desirable to wait for Mr.
      Cummings, and Hagar itself would be no refuge. Hagar was a place where
      criticisms were made, while the green woods have never a comment on any
      folly, but are good comrades to all who have the temper to like them. We
      caught up with him by dint of running and followed silently. It grew dusky
      with the lateness of the afternoon, the pale green light turning dark, and
      we were solemn and rather low in our minds. The Free Traveller seemed to
      grow more vast in outline. Being short of wind he wheezed and moaned and
      what with his swaying as he walked, and his great humpy shoulders and all,
      he looked less and less like a man, and more and more like a Thing.
      Sometimes a tree would creak suddenly near at hand, and I fancied there
      were other people in the woods, whispering and all going the way we went,
      to see what would come to us in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it went on till we came on a little clearing, between the forest and a
      swamp. A black pond, tinted a bit with the sunset, lay below along the
      edge of the swamp; and we knew mainly where we were, for there was a
      highway somewhere beyond the swamp, connecting the valleys of the
      Wyantenaug and the Pilgrim. But none the less for the highway it seemed a
      lonely place, fit for congregations of ghosts. The pond was unknown to me,
      and it looked very still and oily. The forest seemed to crowd about and
      overhang the clearing. On the western side was a heap of caverned
      bowlders, and a fire burned in front with three persons sitting beside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Free Traveller slid along the wood's edge noiselessly but without
      hesitation, and coming to the fire was greeted. One of those who sat there
      was a tall old man with very light blue eyes and prominent, his beard
      white and long. As we came to know, he was called the "Prophet." He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do, Humpy?" so that we knew the Free Traveller was called Humpy,
      either for the shape of his shoulders or for the word he used to express
      himself. There was a younger man, with a retreating chin, and a necktie,
      but no collar, and there was a silent woman with a shawl over her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These are friends o' mine," said the Free Traveller to the older man.
      "Make you acquainted. That's Showman Bobby, and that's the Prophet."
    </p>
    <p>
      A vast chuckle of mirth started then from deep within him and surged
      through his throat,&mdash;such a laugh as would naturally come from a
      whale or some creature of a past age, whose midriff was boundless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ho!" he said. "Bloke with a hay-load lit under him. Ho, Ho!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gen'leman," said the Prophet with a fluent wave of his hand. "Friends of
      Humpy's. That's enough. Any grub, Humpy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Free Traveller brought out a round loaf and some meat done up in a
      newspaper. He might have carried a number of such things about him without
      making any great difference in his contour. The Prophet did not ask about
      the hay-load, or where the bread and meat came from.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daylight was fading now in the clearing, and presently a few thin
      stars were out. It might have occurred to persons of better regulated
      fancies than ours that they were due at supper long since with other
      friends of staider qualities, and that now the wood-paths were too dark to
      follow. Perhaps it did; but it could not have seemed a fair reason to be
      troubled, that we were last seen in company with the Free Traveller, so
      fat and friendly a man. I remember better that the Black Pond reflected no
      stars, that the gleams from the fire played fearful games along the wood's
      edge and the bowlders, and how, beyond the Black Pond, the swamp and the
      close-cuddled hills, the lights of Hamilton crouched low under the sky.
      Opposite us across the fire sat that woman who said nothing, and her face
      was shadowed by her shawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Showman Bobby and the Free Traveller went to sleep, Bobby on his face and
      the Free Traveller accommodating himself. The Prophet sat up and kept us
      company; for we asked him questions naturally, and he seemed interested to
      answer, and was fluent and striking in his speech. They were a runout
      Company and very low in their luck; and it seemed that Bobby was the
      manager, a tumbler himself by profession and in that way of life since
      childhood; and the Free Traveller was apt to be an Australian giant now,
      but in earlier years had been given to footing from place to place and
      living as he might. The Prophet called him a skilful man at getting things
      out of women, partly by experience, and partly by reason of his size and
      the mildness of his manners. As for the Black Pond Clearing, it was well
      known to people of the road, even to orange-men and pack-peddlers, being a
      hidden place with wood and water and shelter in the caves from rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That light in the south is Hamilton," said Chub Leroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prophet started and looked anxiously across the fire, but the woman
      did not move. Then he drew nearer us and spoke lower.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look out," he said. "She ain't right in her head. Bobby painted the
      kid for a pappoose. It took the shakes and died queer. You'd better lie
      down, Cass," speaking across the fire to the woman, who turned her head
      and stared at him directly. "You'd better lie down."
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew back from the fire noiselessly and lay down, wrapping her shawl
      about her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ain't been a circus heeler all my time," began the Prophet. "I been a
      gentleman. Neither has Humpy, I reckon. When I met Bobby it was West and
      he ran a dime museum. He took me in for being a gifted talker, and I was
      that low in my luck. She and Bobby was married sometime, and she did acts
      like the Circassian Beauty, and the Headless Woman, and the Child of the
      Aztecs. Humpy's gifts lies in his size, and he's a powerful strong man,
      too, more than you'd think, and he can get himself up for a savage to look
      like a loose tornado. Look at him now. Ain't he a heap? There was a
      three-eyed dog in the show that you could n't tell that the extra eye was
      n't so hardly, and a snake that was any kind of a snake according as you
      fixed him, his natural color being black. We came East with Forepaugh's.
      Bobby bought a tent in Chicago, and we came to Hamilton a fortnight ago.
      Now there's Hamilton that's a-shining off there with its lights. And we
      run away from it in the night a week come to-morrow, or next day, I
      forget. We left the tent and outfit which was come down on by a Dutch
      grocer for debt, and Cassie's baby was dead in the tent. Bobby painted him
      too thick. And there was a lot of folks looking for us with sticks. Now,
      that was n't right. Think Bobby'd have poisoned his own kid if he'd known
      better about painting him, a kid that was a credit to the show! That's
      what they said. Think folks coming round with sticks and a-howling
      blasphemous is going to help out any family mourning! That ain't my idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then a fellow says, 'I don't know anything about it,' he says, 'and I
      don't want to, but I know you get out of here quick.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "And they drove us out of Hamilton that night ten miles in a covered cart,
      and left us in the road. And the Dutch grocer got the outfit. I reckon the
      circus and the city has buried the kid between 'em. Hey? Sh! She's got a
      quirk. All I know is Fore-paugh's shook us as if we was fleas."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prophet looked over to where Cassie lay, but she did not stir. Anyway,
      if she heard, it was the Prophet's fault. "They're awful poor company," he
      said plaintively, "Bobby and Cass. She takes on terrible. She's took a
      notion that baby ain't buried right. She thinks&mdash;well, I don't know.
      Now that ain't my way of looking at things, but I did n't own the outfit.
      It was Bobby's outfit, and the Dutch grocer got it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a moment. We could hear the Free Traveller asleep and
      rumbling in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where might you chaps come from?" asked the Prophet, suddenly. "Not that
      it's my business. Maybe there might be a town over there? Hey? Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      He grumbled in his beard a few moments more, and then lay down to sleep.
      We drew together and whispered. The three men slept, and the woman said
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is seen that sometimes your most battered and world-worn of men is the
      simplest in his way of looking at things. Or else it was because the
      Prophet was a talker by nature, and Bobby and Cass such poor company, that
      he fell into speech with us on such equal terms. I have set down but
      little of what he said, only enough for the story of the Company, and as I
      happen to recollect it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should have been something earlier than nine o'clock when the Prophet
      lay down to sleep, and half an hour later when we first noticed that the
      woman, Cass, was sitting up. She had her back to us and was looking toward
      the lights of Hamilton. There was no moon and the stars only shone here
      and there between clouds that hurried across the sky, making preparations
      for the storm that came in the morning. The fire burned low, but there was
      no need of it for warmth. The outlines of the hills could be seen. The
      swamp, the pond, and most of the clearing were dark together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she looked cautiously around, first at the three sleepers, and
      then at us. She crept nearer slowly and crouched beside the dull fire,
      throwing back her shawl. Her hair was black and straggled about her face,
      and her eyes were black too, and glittering. The glow of the embers,
      striking upward, made their sockets cavernous, but the eyes stood out in
      the midst of the caverns. One knows well enough that tragedies walk about
      and exchange agreeable phrases with each other. Your tragedy is yours, and
      mine is mine, and in the meanwhile see to it that we look sedate, and
      discuss anything, provided it is of no importance to either. One does not
      choose to be an inscribed monument to the fame of one's private affair.
      But Cassie had lost that instinct of reserve, and her desolation looked
      out of her eyes with dreadful candor. The lines of her face, the droop of
      her figure and even little motions of the hand, signified but one thought.
      I suppose all ideas possible to the world had become as one to her, so
      that three boys cowering away from her seemed only a natural enough part
      of the same subject. It was all one; namely, a baby painted brown, who
      died queerly in a side tent in Hamilton Fair Grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stared at her breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You tell 'em I'm going," she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?" asked Chub.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They ain't no right to&mdash;to&mdash;Who are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was only in passing. She did not wait to be answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You tell 'em I'm going."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for?" persisted Chub.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's six days. Maybe they throwed him where the tin cans are. You tell
      'em I'm going."
    </p>
    <p>
      And she was gone. She must have slipped along the edge of the woods where
      the shadows were densest.
    </p>
    <p>
      We listened a moment or two stupidly. Then we sprang up. It seems as if
      the three men were on their feet at the same instant, wakened by some
      common instinct or pressure of fear. It was a single sound of splashing we
      heard off in the darkness. Bobby was gone, then the Free Traveller, then
      the Prophet. We fell into hollows, over rocks and stumps, and came to the
      pond. The reflection of a star or two glimmered there. The water looked
      heavy, like melted lead, and any ripple that had been was gone, or too
      slight to see. The Free Traveller and Bobby went in and waded about.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you step on her," said Bobby, hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bottom seemed to shelve steeply from the shore. They moved along
      chest-deep, feeling with their feet, and we heard them whispering. The
      Prophet sat down and whimpered softly. They waded a distance along the
      shore, and back. They came close in, whispered together, and went out
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here! I got it," said the Free Traveller. They came out, carrying
      something large and black, and laid it on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It ain't Cassie!" whimpered the Prophet. "It ain't Cassie, is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They all stood about it. The face was like a dim white patch on the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold your jaw," said Bobby. "Hark!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There were voices in the woods above, and a crashing of the branches. They
      were coming nearer and lights were twinkling far back in the wood-path,
      where we had entered the clearing. I do not know what thought it was&mdash;some
      instinct to flee and hide&mdash;that seized the outcasts. They slid away
      into the darkness together, swiftly and without speaking. The Free
      Traveller had Cassie's body on his shoulder, carrying it as a child
      carries a rag doll. The darkness swallowed them at a gulp, and we stood
      alone by the Black Pond. Several men came into the clearing with lanterns,
      villagers from Hagar, Harvey Cummings, the minister, and others, who swung
      their lanterns and shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I suppose that Cassie lies buried to-day somewhere in the South
      Woods, and it may be that no man alive knows where. For none of the
      Company were ever seen again in that part of the country, nor have been
      heard of anywhere now these many years. We can see the lights of Hamilton
      from Hagar as of old, but we seldom think of the Celestial City, or any
      palaces and splendors, but of the multitude of various people who go to
      and fro, each carrying a story.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coming and going of aliens made little difference with Hagar. I
      suppose it was more important there, that Harvey Cummings's hay-load went
      up lawlessly in smoke and flame, and never came to the little pasture barn
      on the Windless Mountain Road.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n Friday
      afternoon, the twenty-eighth of June, Deacon Crockett's horse ran away. It
      was not a suitable thing, not at all what a settled community had a right
      to expect of a horse with stubby legs and no mane to speak of, who had
      grown old in the order of decent conduct. He ran into Mrs. Cullom
      Sanderson's basket phaeton and spilled Mrs. Cullom on the ground, which
      was taking a grave responsibility. It was done in the midst of Hagar.
      Harvey Cummings jumped out of the way and said, "Deb it!" There was no
      concealment about it. Everybody heard of it and said it was astonishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of the deacon's horse was Joppa. The deacon's father-in-law,
      Captain David Brett, had an iron-gray named Borneo. Borneo and Joppa did
      not agree, on account of Borneo's kicking Joppa in the ribs to show his
      contempt. It was natural that he should have this contempt, being sleek
      and spirited himself, with a nautical gait that every one admitted to be
      taking; and Joppa did not think it unnatural in him to show it. Without
      questioning the justice of Borneo's position, he disliked being kicked in
      the ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Borneo had been eating grass by the roadside; Joppa stood harnessed in
      front of the horse-block; Mrs. Crockett stood on the horse-block; Borneo
      came around and kicked Joppa in the ribs; Joppa ran away; Mrs. Crockett
      shrieked; Harvey Cummings said "Deb it!" and Mrs. Cullom Sanderson was
      spilled. She weighed two hundred pounds and covered a deal of ground when
      she was spilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the bridge and tore along the Salem Road, his stubby legs
      pattering under him, and a great fear in his soul of the shouting village
      behind. Angelica and Willy Flint saw him coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a runaway!" shouted Angelica.
    </p>
    <p>
      Willy Flint continued swinging on the gate. He thought it his place to be
      self-contained and accurate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's Joppa," he said calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Angelica did not care for appearances. She shied a clam-shell at
      Joppa, said "Hi there!" and jumped around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joppa swerved sharply, the deacon's buggy turned several sides up, if that
      is possible, bobbed along behind, and then broke loose at the thills.
      Joppa fled madly up the side road that leads to Scrabble Up and Down, and
      disappeared over the crest of the hill, leaving Angelica and Willy Flint
      to gloat over the wreck of the buggy. It gratified a number of their
      instincts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The region called Scrabble Up and Down, as well as the road which leads to
      it, is distinguished by innumerable small steep hills and hollows. For the
      rest, it is a sandy and ill-populated district, and a lonely road.
      Westward of it lies a wilderness of underbrush and stunted trees, rising
      at last into exultant woods and billowing over the hills mile upon mile to
      the valley of the Wyantenaug. The South Woods do not belong to Scrabble Up
      and Down. They are put there to show Scrabble Up and Down what it cannot
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road winds around hillocks and down hollows in an aimless fashion; and
      for that reason it is not possible to see much of it at a time. When the
      villagers of Hagar reached the top of the first hill, Joppa was nearly a
      mile away, his stubby legs rather tired, his spirit more tranquil, and
      himself out of sight of the villagers of Hagar. He saw no point in turning
      back. Hagar gave him but a dull and unideal life, plodding between shafts
      before the austere and silent deacon, unaccountably smacked with a whip,
      and in constant contrast with Borneo's good looks. Joppa had not many
      ideas and little imagination. He did not feel drawn to go back. Moreover
      he smelt something damp and fresh in the direction of the woods which
      absorbed him. He stopped, sniffed, and looked around. The fence was broken
      here and there, as fences generally were in Scrabble Up and Down. The
      leaves were budding; there was a shimmer of green on the distant woods;
      and presently Joppa was wandering through the brush and scrub trees
      westward. The broken shafts dragged quietly beside him. He lifted his head
      a little higher than usual and had an odd feeling, as if he were enjoying
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tumult, row, or excitement of any kind was considered by the children of
      Hagar a thing to be desired, assisted, and remembered gratefully. Some of
      the elders were much of the same mind. Joppa's action was therefore
      popular in Hagar, the more so that it was felt to be incongruous; and,
      when by no search that Friday afternoon nor the following Saturday could
      he be found, his reputation rose in leaps. He had gone over the hill and
      vanished like a ghost, commonplace, homely, plodding, downcast Joppa,
      known to Hagar in that fashion these dozen or more years and suddenly
      become the loud talk of the day. The road to Scrabble Up and Down and the
      roads far beyond were searched. Inquiry spread to Salem and to Gilead. On
      Saturday night notices were posted here and there by happy jokers relating
      to Joppa, one on the church door of Hagar requesting the prayers of the
      congregation. Mr. Atherton Bell thought the deacon's horse like "the
      deacon's one-hoss shay," in that he had lasted an extraordinary time
      intact, and then disintegrated. Joppa had become a mystery, an excitement,
      a cause of wit. A definite addition had been made to the hoarded stock of
      tradition and jest; the lives of all seemed the richer. An atmosphere of
      deep and tranquil mirth pervaded the village, a kind of mellow light of
      humor, in the focus of which stood Deacon Crockett, and writhed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hoped that the minister would preach on Joppa. He preached on
      "human insignificance," and read of the war-horse, "Hast thou clothed his
      neck with thunder?" but it was thought not to refer to Joppa.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the children of Hagar, did they not dream of him, and hear him
      thumping and blundering by in the winds of the dim night? They saw no
      humor in him, nor in the deacon. Rather it was a serious mystery, and they
      went about with the impression of it on their faces, having faith that the
      outcome would be worthy of the promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harvey Cummings thought that the war-horse did not refer to Joppa, and
      said so on the steps of the church. "There wan'd no thudder aboud him. He
      was the meekest hoss in Hamilton County. He run away on accound of his
      shyness."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cummings had no palate to speak of, and his consonants were uncertain.
      Mr. Atherton Bell threw out his chest, as an orator should, put his thumbs
      in the armholes of his vest, and gazed at Mr. Cummings with a kindling
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For a meek horse," he said impressively, "he showed&mdash;a&mdash;great
      resolution when he spilled Mrs. Cullom Sanderson. I declare to you,
      Harvey, I give you my word, sir, I would not have missed seeing Mrs.
      Cullom spilled for a government contract."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, indeed, Mr. Bell!" said Mrs. Cullom Sanderson, rustling past,
      "clothed with thunder" and black silk. Mr. Atherton Bell recovered himself
      slowly and moved to a greater distance from the church door. He was a
      politician and a legislator, but he found diplomacy difficult. Several
      others gathered around, desiring to hear the statesman. "Now suppose,
      Harvey, suppose the deacon too should take a notion to run away, knock
      over Mrs. Cullom, you know, and&mdash;a&mdash;disappear. Imagine it,
      Harvey."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cummings shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bell took off his hat and smiled expansively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a pleasing thought, ha! He might be translated&mdash;a&mdash;Elijah,
      you know. He might leave his mantle to&mdash;to me. Hitherto the deacon
      has lacked dramatic interest. Contact between Mrs. Cullom and Deacon
      Crockett would&mdash;" (here his hearers stirred appreciatively) "would
      have dramatic interest&mdash;Ah, good morning, deacon, good morning, sir.
      We were speaking of your loss. We&mdash;a&mdash;trust it will not be
      permanent."
    </p>
    <p>
      The deacon moved on without answering. Mr. Atherton Bell's spirit fell
      again, and he wiped his forehead nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be a painful thing if a man were suddenly to enter into full
      sight of himself as others see him; it is a measure of distress even to
      have a passing glimpse&mdash;not so much because he sees a worse man, but
      because he sees a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deacon Crockett had never asked himself how others saw him. He was not a
      flexible man. The grooves in which his life ran had been worn slowly in a
      hard substance. Its purports and ends had always seemed to him accurately
      measured and bounded. He exacted his rights, paid his dues, and had no
      doubts about either; held his conscience before him as a sword, dividing
      truth from falsehood. He stood by the faith of his forefathers, gave up no
      jot or tittle of it; there were no hazy outlying regions in that faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a man observes himself to be a well-defined thing in certain
      relations with other well-defined things, has no more doubt of the meaning
      of his presence on the earth than of the function of a cogwheel in his
      watch, his footing seems singularly secure; the figure he makes in his own
      eyes not only grows rigid with habit, but seems logically exact to begin
      with. To doubt the function of the cog-wheel is to put in question the
      watch, which is impossible and a sufficient demonstration. Other men's
      opinions, if worth anything or considered at all, are assumed to be
      respectful; and the assumption seems just.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should he not feel impregnable in his personal dignity, who sees
      himself sufficiently fulfilling his function in an ordered scheme, a just
      man, elected to become perfect? Personal dignity is at least not a vulgar
      ambition. It was the deacon's ambition, the thing which he wished to
      characterize his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deacon walked down the path from the church. He walked quietly and
      stiffly as usual, but the spirit within him was worse than angry; it was
      confused. The whole neighborhood seemed to be laughing at him; his fingers
      tingled at the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that was not the source of his confusion. It was, strangely, that
      there seemed to be no malice in the laughter, only a kind of amused
      friendliness. An insult and a resentment can be understood by a man of
      function, within his function; his resentment maintains his equilibrium.
      But, quite the contrary, his neighbors seemed timidly to invite him into
      the joke. Of all the hidden ways of laughter one comes last to that in
      which he may walk and be amused with himself; although it is only there
      that he is for the first time entirely comfortable in the world. Tim Rae,
      the town drunkard, met him where the path across the Green joins the road.
      It was Tim's habit to flee from the deacon's approach with feeble
      subterfuges, not because the deacon ever lectured him, but because the
      deacon's presence seemed to foreshorten his stature, and gave him a chill
      in the stomach, where he preferred "something warm." Yet he ambled amiably
      across the road, and his air of good-fellowship could not have been
      greater if they had met in a ditch on equal terms of intoxication.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What think, deacon," he gurgled. "I was dream-in' las' night, 'bout Joppa
      comin' down my chimney, damned if he did n't."
    </p>
    <p>
      The deacon stopped and faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may be drunk, sir," he said slowly, "on Saturday night, and you may
      curse on the Sabbath; but you <i>may not</i> expect me to sympathize with
      you&mdash;in either."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Tim Rae slunk away foreshortened of stature and cold in the stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monday morning was the first of May; and on May-day, unless the season
      were backward and without early flowers, the children of Hagar would go
      after ground-pine for the May-baskets, and trailing arbutus to fill them
      with. They would hang the baskets on the door-handles of those who were
      thought worthy, popular persons such as the minister and Sandy Campbell;
      on Mr. Atherton Bell's door-handle on account of Bobby Bell, who was a
      gentleman but not allowed to be out nights because of his inferior age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ground-pine grows in many places, but early arbutus is a whimsical flower,
      as shy as first love. It is nearly always to be found somewhere in the
      South Woods. And the South Woods are to be reached, not by Scrabble Up and
      Down, but along the Windless Mountain Road, across the Mill Stream, and by
      cart-paths which know not their own minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deacon drove home from Gilead Monday afternoon, and saw the children
      noisily jumping the Mill Stream where the line of bowlders dams up the
      stream and makes deep quiet water above. Their voices, quarrelling and
      laughing, fell on his ear with an unfamiliar sound. Somehow they seemed
      significant, at least suggesting odd trains of thought. He found himself
      imagining how it would seem to go Maying; and the incongruity of it
      brought a sudden frown of mental pain and confusion to his forehead. And
      so he drove into Hagar.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if he had followed the May-day revellers, as he had oddly imagined
      himself doing, he would have gone by those winding cart-paths, fragrant
      with early growth, and might have seen the children break from the woods
      with shouts into a small opening above a sunken pond; he might even have
      heard the voice of Angelica Flint rise in shrill excitement:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Why, there's Joppa!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      Some minutes after six, the first shading of the twilight being in the
      air, the villagers of Hagar, whose houses lay along the north and south
      road, rose on one impulse and came forth into the street. And standing by
      their gates and porches, they saw the children go by with lost Joppa in
      their midst. Around his neck was a huge flopping wreath of ground-pine and
      arbutus. The arbutus did not stay in very well, and there was little of it&mdash;only
      bits stuck in here and there. Joppa hung his head low, so that the wreath
      had to be held on. He did not seem cheerful; in fact, the whole cortge
      had a subdued though important air, as if oppressed by a great thought and
      conscious of ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister and the other neighbors along the street came out and
      followed. Some dozen or more at last stood on the brow of the slight hill
      looking down to the deacon's house; and they too felt conscious of
      something, of a ceremony, a suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Atherton Bell met the children and drove his buggy into the ditch,
      stood up and gazed over the back of it with an absorbed look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel curious how the deacon will take it," said the minister. "I&mdash;I
      feel anxious."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Atherton Bell said, it got him. He said something too about "dramatic
      interest" and "a good betting chance he'll cut up rough"; but no one
      answered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The procession halted outside the deacon's gate. A tendency to giggle on
      the part of certain girls was sternly suppressed by Angelica Flint. Willy
      Flint led Joppa cautiously up the board walk and tied him to a pillar of
      the porch; the company began to retreat irregularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the deacon, tall and black-coated, stood in the doorway, Mrs.
      Crockett at his elbow pouring forth exclamations; and the retreat became a
      flight. Little Nettie Paulus fell behind; she stood in the middle of the
      road and wailed piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deacon glared at Joppa and Joppa's grotesque necklace, looked after
      the fleeing children and saw on the brow of the hill the group of his
      fellow-townsmen. His forehead flushed and he hesitated. At last he took
      the wreath awkwardly from Joppa's neck, went into the house and shut the
      door. The wreath hung in his front window seven months, and fell to pieces
      about the end of November. Joppa died long after of old age and
      rheumatism.

    <h2>
      THE ELDER' SEAT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>etween the mill
      and the miller's house in Hagar the Mill Stream made a broad pool with a
      yellow bottom of pebbles and sand. It was sometimes called the
      Mediterranean. If you wished to cross the Mill Stream, there was a plank
      below, which was good to jounce on also, though apt to tip you into the
      water. The pool was shallow, about twenty feet across and as long as you
      might care to go upstream,&mdash;as far as the clay bank, anyway, where
      Chub Leroy built the city of Alexandria. Jeannette Paulus walked all over
      Alexandria to catch a frog, and made a mess of it, and did not catch the
      frog. That is the way of things in this world. Alexandria fell in a
      moment, with all her palaces and towers. But there were other cities, and
      commerce was lively on the Mediterranean.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the nearer side, against the gray, weatherbeaten flank of the miller's
      house was a painted bench, for convenience of the morning sun and
      afternoon shade; and I call it now the Elders' Seat, because Captain David
      Brett and others were often to be seen sitting there in the sun or shade.
      I remember the minister was there, and Job Mather, the miller, whenever
      his grist ran low, so that he let his stem millstones cease to grind.
      These were the three to whom the Elders' Seat seemed to us to belong by
      right of continuance, because our short memories ran not to the contrary.
      Captain David was well in his seventies, the miller not far behind, and
      Mr. Royce already gray-haired. They sat and watched the rise and fall of
      cities, the growth and decay of commerce, the tumult of conquests, and the
      wreck of high ambition. They noticed that one thing did not change nor
      cease, namely, the ripple of the stream; just as if, in history, there
      really were a voice distinguishable that went murmuring forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the fall of Alexandria Damascus was built, but inland, so that it
      had to be reached by caravan; and Moses Durfey laid the foundations of
      Byzantium where the pool narrowed into rushing water, and Venice was
      planted low in a marshy place hard by the seven hills of Rome. But you
      must know that Bobby Bell built the city of Rome absurdly, and filled it
      with pot-holes to keep frogs in and floating black bugs, so that it was
      impossible to hold it against the Carthaginians. There were wars in those
      days. These were the main marts of trade, but there were quays and
      fortresses elsewhere; and it should be told sometime how the Barbary
      pirates came down. Rome was in a bad way, for Bobby had one aquarium in
      the Campus Martius, and another where the Forum should have been. There
      was nothing flourishing but the aqueducts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three Elders would sit leaning forward, watching the changes of
      fortune and event that went on from hour to hour by the Mediterranean. The
      captain smoked his pipe; the minister rested his chin on his cane; the
      miller's hands were on his knees, his large white face stolid, his heavy
      lips seldom moving. He was a thinking man, the miller,&mdash;a
      slow-moving, slow-speaking, persistent man, and a fatalist in his way of
      thinking, though he used no such term; it was his notion of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked of old history out of Gibbon and Grote and the Seven
      Monarchies, and they talked of things that had happened to them as men in
      the world; but the things which they thought of most often, in watching
      the children and the Mill Stream, they said little about, for these had
      not happened a thousand or two thousand years before, nor twenty or
      thirty, but just sixty or seventy. And this was why they came so often to
      the Elders' Seat, because something dim and happy seemed to come up to
      them, like a mist, from the Mill Stream, where the children quarrelled and
      contrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell ye what ailed Rome," said Captain David. "She needed to be
      keeled and scraped. She fouled her bottom!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister answered slowly: "No, she was rotten within. She lost the
      faith in God and in man that keeps a people sound."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ho! Well, then she wa'n't handled right."
    </p>
    <p>
      The miller rubbed his thumb slowly on the palm of his hand. "She was
      grinded out," he said. "She couldn't help it. Corn can't keep itself from
      meal when the stones gets at it. No more a man can't keep his bones from
      dust, nor a people, either, I'm thinking, when its time comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister shook his head. "I don't like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know as I do, either. And I don't know as that makes any
      difference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ho!" said the captain. "Bobby's got a new frog!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Chub Leroy cried out in despair: "Look out, Bobby! You're stepping on
      the Colosseum!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I would not pretend to say how long the Elders' Seat had stood there, or
      how many years the Elders had come to it now and again; but I remember
      that it seemed to us very permanent, in a world of shifting empires, where
      Alexandria was suddenly walked upon and deserted, and Venice went down the
      current in a rainy night, and was spoken of no more. We could not remember
      when it had not stood in its place. It was a kind of Olympus to us, or
      Delphi, where we went for oracles on shipping and other matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterward we grew up, and became too old to dabble and make beautiful
      things of gray clay, except Chub Leroy, who is still doing something of
      that kind, cutting and building with clay and stone. But the Elders' Seat
      remained, and the Elders watched other children, as if nothing had
      happened. Only, Captain David had trouble to keep his pipe in his mouth.
      So that when the Elders' Seat took its first journey, it seemed very
      difficult for us to understand,&mdash;even for those who were too old to
      dabble in gray clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not more than a quarter of a mile from the mill, past the drug
      store, the Crocketts' house, where Captain David lived, and so on by the
      crossroads, to the minister's, with the graveyard just beyond. I remember
      how very yellow and dusty the road was in the summer of '86, so that the
      clay bottom cracked off in flat pieces, which could be gathered up; and
      then, if you climbed the wall with care enough, you could scale them at
      woodchucks. August was sultry and still. The morning-glories drooped on
      Captain David's porch, and the pigeons on the roof went to sleep more than
      was natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister and Job Mather sat, one afternoon, in the Elders' Seat; for
      Captain David, he had not gone out through his gate those many days. There
      was history enough in process on the Mediterranean. The Americans and
      Carthaginians were preparing to have a battle, on account of docks that
      ran too near together. The Elders discovered that they did not care about
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The miller got to his feet, and lifted one end of the bench. "Come," he
      said gruffly. "Let's move it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hey!" said the minister, looking troubled and a bit lost. Then his lips
      trembled. "Yes, Job. That's so, Job. We'd better move it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The children came up from the Mediterranean in a body, and stared. It was
      much to them as if, in Greece, the gods had risen up and gone away, for
      unknown reasons, taking Olympus with them. The old men went along the
      yellow, dusty road with very shuffling steps, carrying the Elders' Seat,
      one at each end, till they turned into Captain David's garden and put it
      down against the porch. Mrs. Crockett came to the door, and held up her
      hands in astonishment. Captain David was helped out. He was faded and worn
      with pain. He settled himself in the Elders' Seat. It did not seem
      possible to say anything. The captain smoked his pipe; the minister rested
      his chin on his cane; the miller's hands were on his knees, his large
      white face stolid and set.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm goin' to shell those peas to-morrow," began the captain at last. Then
      his voice broke, and a mist came into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I bet ye the Americans are licking the Carthaginians."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the contrary, the Americans and Carthaginians, with other nations, were
      hanging over the picket fence, staring and bewildered. What was the use of
      mere human wars, if primeval things could be suddenly changed? The grass
      might take a notion to come up pink or the seas to run out at the bottom,
      and that sort of thing would make a difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun dropped low in the west, and presently Chub Leroy, who built the
      city of Alexandria ten years before, came slowly along in the shadow of
      the maples, and St. Agnes Macree was with him. She was old Caspar Macree's
      granddaughter, and he was a charcoal-burner on the Cattle Ridge long ago.
      They were surprised to see the Elders' Seat, and stopped a moment. St.
      Agnes looked up at him and smiled softly, and Chub's eyes kept saying,
      "Sweetheart, sweetheart," all the time. Then they went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember&mdash;" said Captain David, and stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh! So do I," said the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do! Well, Job, do you remember? Ain't it the remarkablest thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The miller's heavy face was changed with a slow, embarrassed smile. And
      all these three sat a long time very still, while the sunlight slanted
      among the morning-glories and the pigeons slept on the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a day in September when the minister and the miller were alone
      again on the Elders' Seat, but Captain David lay in his bed near the
      window. He slept a great deal, and babbled in his half dreams: sometimes
      about ships and cordage, anchorage in harbors and whaling in the south
      seas; and at times about some one named "Kitty." I never heard who Kitty
      was. He said something or other "wasn't right." He took the trouble and
      the end of things all in good part, and bore no grudge to any one for it;
      it seemed only natural, like coming to anchor at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When a man gets legs like mine," he said, "it's time he took another way
      of getting round. Something like a fish'd be my notion. Parson, a man gets
      the other side of somewhere, he can jump round lively-like, same as he was
      a boy, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister murmured something about "our Heavenly Father," and Captain
      David said softly: "I guess he don't call us nothing but boys. He says,
      'Shucks! it ain't natural for 'em to behave.' Don't ye think, parson? Him,
      he might see an old man like me and tell him, 'Glad to see ye, sonny';
      same as Harrier in Doty's Slip. The boys come in after a year out, or
      maybe three years, and old man Harrier, he says, 'Glad to see ye, sonny';
      and the boys gets terrible drunk. He kept a junk-shop, Harrier."
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister tried to answer, but could not make it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw a ship go down sudden-like. It was in '44. It was inside Cape Cod.
      Something blowed her up inside. Me, I've took my time, I have. What ye
      grumbling about, parson?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning the shutters were closed, and all about the house was
      still. The pigeons were cooing on the roof of the porch; and Captain David
      was dead, without seeing any reason to grumble. Down at the mill the
      miller watched his monotonous millstones grinding slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Elders' Seat was moved once more after Captain David died, not back to
      the Mediterranean, but further up the yellow road and into the minister's
      yard, facing westward. From there the captain's white slab could be seen
      through the cemetery gate. The two Elders occupied the seat some years,
      and then went in through the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Elders' Seat and its journeys from place to place seemed to have
      some curious meaning, hardly to be spelled. I imagine this far, at least:
      that at a certain point it became to the two more natural, more quiet and
      happy, to turn their eyes in the direction the captain had gone than in
      the direction they had all come. It pleased them then to move the Elders'
      Seat a little nearer to the gate. And when the late hour came, it was
      rather a familiar matter. The minister went in to look for his Master, and
      the miller according to his' notion of things.

    <h2>
      THE ROMANCE OF THE INSTITUTE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>ot quite two
      centuries of human life have gone quietly in Wimberton, and for the most
      part it has been on Main and Chester Streets. Main Street is a quarter of
      a mile long and three hundred feet wide, with double roads, and between
      them a clean lawn shaded by old elms. Chester Street is narrow and crowded
      with shops, and runs from the middle of Main down-hill to the railway and
      the river. It is the business street for Wimberton and the countryside of
      fifteen miles about. Main Street is surrounded by old houses of honorable
      frontage, two churches, and the Solley Institute, which used to be called
      "Solley's Folly" by frivolous aliens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Solley, who owned the mines up the river and the foundries that have
      been empty and silent these many years, founded it in 1840. At the time I
      remember best the Institute had twenty-one trustees, lady patronesses,
      matrons, and nurses; and three beneficiaries, or representatives of the
      "aged, but not destitute, of Hamilton County." That seemed odd to the
      alien.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Solley need not have been so rigid about the equipment and
      requirements of admission, except that he had in mind an institution of
      dignity. It stood at the head of Main Street, with wide piazzas like a
      hotel. The aristocracy of old Wimberton used to meet there and pass the
      summer afternoons. The young people gave balls in the great parlors, and
      the three beneficiaries looked on, and found nothing to complain of in the
      management. What matter if it were odd? True Wimberton folk never called
      the Institute a folly, but only newcomers, before years of residence made
      them endurable and able to understand Wimberton. Failure is a lady of
      better manners than Success, who is forward, complacent, taking herself
      with unpleasant seriousness. Imagine the Institute swarming with people
      from all parts of the county, a staring success in beneficence!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Solley's idea was touched with delicacy. It was not a home for
      Hamilton County poor, but for those who, merely lingering somewhat on the
      slow descent, found it a lonely road. For there is a period in life, of
      varying length, when, one's purposes having failed or been unfulfilled,
      the world seems quite occupied by other people who are busy with
      themselves. Life belongs at any one time to the generation which is making
      the most of it. A beneficiary was in a certain position of respectable
      humility. But I suppose it was not so much Mr. Solley's discrimination as
      that in 1840 his own house was empty of all but a few servants; and so out
      of his sense of loneliness grew his idea of a society of the
      superannuated. That was the Solley Institute.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not so difficult to recreate old Wimberton of seventy years back,
      for the same houses stood on Main Street, and the familiar names were then
      heard&mdash;Solley, Gore, Cutting, Gilbert, Cass, Savage. The elms were
      smaller, with fewer lights under them at night, and gravel paths instead
      of asphalt.
    </p>
    <p>
      One may even call up those who peopled the street, whom time has disguised
      or hidden away completely. Lucia Gore has dimples,&mdash;instead of those
      faded cheeks one remembers at the Institute,&mdash;and quick movements,
      and a bewildering prettiness, in spite of the skirts that made women look
      like decanters or tea-bells in 1830. She is coming down the gravel
      sidewalk with a swift step, a singular fire and eagerness of manner, more
      than one would suppose Miss Lucia to have once possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there is the elder Solley, already with that worn, wintry old face we
      know from his portrait at the Institute, and John Solley, the son, both
      with high-rolled collars, tall hats, and stiff cravats. Women said that
      John Solley was reckless, but one only notices that he is very tall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad to see you are in a hurry, too, my dear. We might hurry up the
      wedding among us all," says the elder Solley, with a grim smile and a bow.
      "Ha! Glad to see you in a hurry;" and he passes on, leaving the two
      together. Lucia flushes and seems to object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is not that Mrs. Andrew Cutting in the front window of the gabled house
      directly behind them? Then she is thinking how considerate it is, how
      respectful to Main Street, that John and Lucia are to marry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The past springs up quickly, even to little details. Mrs. Cutting wears a
      morning cap, has one finger on her cheek, and is wondering why John looks
      amused and Lucia in a temper. "He will have to behave himself," thinks
      Mrs. Cutting. "Lucia is&mdash;dear me, Lucia is very decided. I don't
      really know that John likes to behave himself." And all these people of
      1830 are clearly interested in their own affairs, and care little for
      those who will look back at them, seventy years away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love climbs trees in the Hesperides, day in and out, very busy with their
      remarkable fruit, the dragon lying beneath with indifferent jaws. Do we
      observe how recklessly the young man reaches out, and how slightly he
      knows the nature of his footing? The branches of such apple trees as bear
      golden fruit are notoriously brittle. He might drop into the lazy throat
      of Fate by as easy an accident as the observer into figures of speech, and
      the dragon care little about the matter. That indifference of Fate is
      hard, for it seems an expense for no value received by any one. We are
      advised to be as little melancholy as possible, and charge it to profit
      and loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is well known that John Solley left Wimberton late one night in
      October, 1830. In the morning the two big stuccoed houses of Gore and
      Solley looked at each other across the street under the yellow arch of
      leaves with that mysterious expression which they ever after seemed to
      possess to the dwellers on Main Street. And the Gores' housemaid picked up
      a glittering something from the fell of the bearskin rug on the parlor
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Land! It's Miss Lucia's engagement ring. She's a careless girl!" Plannah
      was a single woman of fifty, and spoke with strong moral indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some mornings later Mr. Solley came stiffly down his front steps, crossed
      the street under the yellow elms, and went in between the white pillars of
      the Gore house. Mr. Gore was a middle-aged man, chubby, benevolent,
      gray-haired, deliberate. He sank back in his easy-chair in fat
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear me! I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was called.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Solley wishes to ask you&mdash;a&mdash;something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish to ask if my son has treated you badly," said Mr. Solley, most
      absurdly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all, Mr. Solley."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia's eyes were suddenly hot and shining.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, but if John is a scoundrel, you will do me a favor by
      telling me so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is he? I shall do nothing of the kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am about to write to my son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that's nothing to me," she cried, and went swiftly out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I suppose he's only a fool," said Mr. Solley, grimly. "I knew that.
      Spirited girl, Gore, very. Good morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me!" said Mr. Gore, mildly, rubbing his glasses. "How quickly they
      do things!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Elderly gentlemen whose wives are dead and children adventuring in the
      Hesperides should take advice. Mrs. Cutting might have advised against
      this paragraph in Mr. Solley's letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have taken the trouble to inquire whether you have been acting as a
      gentleman should. Inasmuch as Miss Lucia seemed to imply that the matter
      no longer interests her, I presume she has followed her own will, which is
      certainly a woman's right. With respect to the Michigan lands, I inclose
      surveys. You will do well," etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Solley had not for many years thought of the Hesperides as a more
      difficult piece of property to survey than another. Men and women followed
      their own wills there as elsewhere, and were quite right, so long as they
      did business honorably. And Mr. Gore had been a managed and advised man
      all his wedded life, and had not found, that it increased his happiness.
      That advice had always tended to embark him on some enterprise that was
      fatiguing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good woman, Letitia," often ran Mr. Gore's reflections; and then, with
      a sense of furtiveness, as if Letitia somewhere in the spiritual universe
      might overhear his thought, "a little masterful&mdash;a&mdash;spirited,
      very."
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was hard for Wimberton people to have a secret shut up among them.
      It was not respectful to Main Street, with John Solley fleeing
      mysteriously in the night and coming no more to Wimberton, and Lucia going
      about with her nose in the air, impossible to sympathize with. Some months
      passed, and Lucia seemed more subdued, then very quiet indeed, with a
      liking to sit by her father's side, to Mr. Gore's slight uneasiness. She
      might wish him to do something.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew no more than Wimberton what had happened to send John westward and
      Lucia to sitting beside him in unused silence; but he differed from
      Wimberton in thinking it perhaps not desirable to know. He would pat her
      hand furtively, and polish his glasses, without seeming to alter the
      situation. Once he asked timidly if it were not dull for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've thought sometimes&mdash;sometimes&mdash;a&mdash;I don't remember
      what I was going to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia's head went down till it almost rested on his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father&mdash;do you know&mdash;where John is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why&mdash;a&mdash;of course, Mr. Solley&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, father! No!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I might inquire around&mdash;a&mdash;somewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! Oh, promise me you won't ask any one! Promise!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, my dear," said Mr. Gore, very much confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is no matter," said Lucia, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gore thought for several minutes, but no idea seemed to occur to him,
      and it relieved him to give it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Months have a way of making years by a rapid arithmetic, and years that
      greet us with such little variety of expression are the more apt to step
      behind with faint reproach and very swiftly. Mr. Solley founded the
      Institute in 1840, and died. The Solley house stood empty, and Miss Lucia
      Gore by that time was living alone, except for the elderly maiden, Hannah.
      Looking at the old elms of Wimberton, grave and orderly, there is much to
      be said for a vegetable life. There is no right dignity but in the slow
      growths of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elms increased their girth; the railway crept up the river; the young
      men went to Southern battle-fields, and some of them returned; children of
      a second generation walked in the Hesperides; the Institute was reduced to
      three beneficiaries; Main Street smelled of tar from the asphalt
      sidewalks; Chester Street was prosperous. Banks failed in '73, and "Miss
      Lucia has lost everything," said Wimberton gossip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Solley house was alternately rented and empty, the Gore house was
      sold, Miss Lucia went up to the Institute, and gossip in Wimberton woke
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course the Institute is not like other places, but then&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Lucia was such a lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it's a charity, after all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very sensible of Miss Lucia, I'm sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was engaged to old Institute Solley's son once, but it ended with a
      bump."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then Miss Lucia goes to the Institute who might have gone to the Solley
      house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that is what one doesn't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Lucia a beneficiary! But isn't that rather embarrassing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder if she&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, it was centuries ago. One does n't think of love-affairs fifty
      years old. They dry up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Respectable, and you pay a little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But a charity really."
    </p>
    <p>
      That year the public library was built on Main and Gilbert Streets, the
      great elm fell down in the Institute yard, Mrs. Andrew Cutting died at
      ninety-eight, with good sense and composure, and here is a letter written
      by Miss Lucia to Babbie Cutting. Babbie Cutting, I remember, had eyes like
      a last-century romance, never fancy-free, and her dolls loved and were
      melancholy, when we were children together under the elms in Wimberton.
      The letter is written in thin, flowing lines on lavender paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>My dear Child</i>: I am afraid you thought that your question offended
      me, but it did not, indeed. I was engaged to Mr. John Solley many years
      ago. I think I had a very hasty temper then, which I think has quite
      wasted away now, for I have been so much alone. But then I sometimes fell
      into dreadful rages. Mr. Solley was a very bold man, not easily influenced
      or troubled, who laughed at my little faults and whims more than I thought
      he should.
    </p>
    <p>
      You seemed to ask what sudden and mysterious thing happened to us, but, my
      dear, one's life is chiefly moved by trifles and little accidents and
      whims. Mr. Solley came one night, and I fancied he had been neglecting me,
      for I was very proud, more so than ordinary life permits women to be. I
      remember that he stood with his hands behind him, smiling. He looked so
      easy and strong, so impossible to disturb, and said, "You're such a little
      spitfire, Lucia," and I was so angry, it was like hot flames all through
      my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cried, "How dare you speak to me so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," he said, and laughed. "It seems perilous."
    </p>
    <p>
      I tore his ring from my finger and threw it in his face. It struck his
      forehead and fell to the floor without any sound. There was a tiny red cut
      on his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is your engagement ring," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take it away. I want nothing more to do with you," I cried&mdash;very
      foolishly, for I did, and my anger was going off in fright. He turned
      around and went from the house. The maid found the ring in the morning.
      Mr. Solley had left Wimberton that night. Well, my dear, that is all. I
      thought he would have come back. It seemed as if he might. I am so old now
      that I do not mind talking, but I was proud then, and women are not
      permitted to be very proud. Do your romances tell you that women are
      foolish and men are sometimes hard on them?
    </p>
    <p>
      That is not good romance at all, but if you will come to see me again I
      will tell you much better romances than mine that I have heard, for other
      people's lives are interesting, even if mine has been quite dull.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will you put this letter away to remember me by? But do not think of me as
      a complaining old woman, for I have had a long life of leisure and many
      friends. I do not think any one who really cares for me will do so the
      less for my living at the Institute, and only those we love are of real
      importance to us. It is kind of you to visit me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Your Affectionate Friend.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      So half a century is put lightly aside; Miss Lucia has found it quite
      dull; and here is the year 1885, when, as every one knows, John Solley
      came back to Wimberton, a tall old man with a white mustache, heavy brows,
      and deep eyes. Men thought it an honor to the town that the great and rich
      Mr. Solley, so dignified a man, should return to spend his last days in
      Wimberton. He would be its ornamental citizen, the proper leader of its
      aristocracy. But Babbie Cutting thought of another function. What matter
      for the melancholy waste of years, fifty leagues across? Love should walk
      over it triumphant, unwearied, and find a fairer romance at the end. Were
      there not written in the books words to that effect? Babbie moved in a
      world of dreams, where knights were ever coming home from distant places,
      or, at least, where every one found happiness after great trouble. She
      looked up into Mr. Solley's eyes and thought them romantic to a degree.
      When she heard he had never married the thing seemed as good as proved.
      And the little old lady at the Institute with the old-fashioned rolled
      curls above her ears&mdash;what a sequel!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a white winter day. The elms looked so cold against the sky that it
      was difficult to remember they had ever been green, or believe it was in
      them to put forth leaves once more. The wind drove the sharp-edged
      particles of snow directly in Babbie's face, and she put her head down,
      covering her mouth with her furs. She turned in at the Solley house, and
      found herself in the drawing-room, facing that tall, thin,
      military-looking old man, and feeling out of breath and troubled what to
      do first. But Mr. Solley was not a man to let any girl whatever be ill at
      ease, and surely not one with cheeks and eyes and soft hair like Babbie
      Cutting. Presently they were experienced friends. Babbie sat in Mr.
      Solley's great chair and stretched her hands toward the fire. Mr. Solley
      was persuaded to take up his cigar again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had not dared to hope," he said, "that my native place would welcome me
      so charmingly. I have made so many new friends, or rather they seemed to
      be friends already, though unknown to me, that I seem to begin life again.
      I seem to start it all over. I should have returned sooner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm sure you should have," said Babbie, eagerly. "And do you know who
      is living at the Institute now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Institute? I had almost forgotten the Institute, and I am a trustee,
      which is very neglectful of duty. Who is living at the Institute now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Lucia Gore."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Solley was silent, and looked at Babbie oddly under his white
      eyebrows, so that her cheeks began to burn, and she was not a little
      frightened, though quite determined and eager.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Lucia lost all her money when the banks failed, and she sold the
      Gore house, and got enough interest to pay her dues and a little more; but
      it seems so sad for Miss Lucia, because people will patronize her, not
      meaning to. But they 're so stupid&mdash;or, at least, it doesn't seem
      like Miss Lucia."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not know she was living," said Mr. Solley, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, how could you&mdash;be that way!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Solley looked steadily at Babbie, and it seemed to him as if her face
      gave him a clue to something that he had groped for in the darkness of
      late, as if some white mist were lifted from the river and he could see up
      its vistas and smoky cataracts. How could he be that way? It is every
      man's most personal and most unsolved enigma&mdash;how he came to be that
      way, to be possible as he is. Up the river he saw a face somewhat like
      Babbie's, somewhat more imperious, but with the same pathetic eagerness
      and desire for abundance of life. How could young John Solley become old
      John Solley? Looking into Babbie's eyes, he seemed able to put the two men
      side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At one time, Miss Barbara," he said, "&mdash;you will forgive my saying
      so,&mdash;I should have resented your reference. Now I am only thinking
      how kind it is of you to forget that I am old."
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbie did not quite understand, and felt troubled, and not sure of her
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Solley," she said, "I&mdash;I have a letter from Miss Lucia. Do you
      think I might show it to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It concerns me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Y-yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked down the room and back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know that you ought, but you have tempted me to wish that you
      would. Thank you." He put on his glasses and read it slowly. Babbie
      thought he read it like a business letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He ought to turn pale or red," she thought. "Oh, he oughtn't to wear his
      spectacles on the end of his nose!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Solley handed back the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Miss Barbara," he said, and began to talk of her
      great-grandmother Cutting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbie blinked back her sudden tears. It was very different from a
      romance, where the pages will always turn and tell you the story
      willingly, where the hero always shows you exactly how he feels. She
      thought she would like to cry somewhere else. She stood up to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry I'm so silly," she said, with a little gulp and trying to be
      dignified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Solley looked amused, so far as that the wrinkles deepened about his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you be a friend of mine?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Babbie, plaintively, but she did not think she would. How
      could she, and he so cold, so prosaic! She went out into the snow, which
      was driving down Main Street from the Institute. It was four by the town
      clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      They said in Wimberton that Mr. Solley left his house at seven o'clock in
      the evening, and that Stephen, the gardener, held an umbrella in front of
      him to keep off the storm all the way up the hill to the Institute. And
      they said, too, that the lights were left burning in the Solley house, and
      the fire on the hearth, and that the book he was reading when Babbie went
      in lay open on the table. The fire burned itself out. Stephen came in
      late, closed the book, and put out the lights, and in the morning went
      about town saying that Mr. Solley was to enter the Institute as a
      beneficiary.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is a secret that on that snowy evening Mr. Solley and Miss Lucia
      sat in the great east parlor of the Institute, with a lamp near by, but
      darkness in all the distances about them. His hands were on his
      gold-headed cane; Miss Lucia's rolls of white curls were very tidy over
      her ears, and her fingers were knitting something placidly. She was saying
      it was "quite impossible. One doesn't want to be absurd at seventy-five."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose not," said Mr. Solley. "I shouldn't mind it. What do you think
      of the other plan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you want my permission to be a beneficiary," said Miss Lucia, with her
      eyes twinkling, "I think it would be a proper humiliation for you. I think
      you deserve it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be no humiliation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was for me&mdash;some."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shall be so no more. I'll make them wish they were all old enough to
      do the same&mdash;hem&mdash;confound them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you think of it that way, John?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Solley was silent for some moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know, I have been a busy man," he said at last, "but there was
      nothing in it all that I care to think over now. And to-day, for the first
      time, that seemed to me strange. It was shown to me&mdash;that is, I saw
      it was strange. We have only a few years left, and you will let me be
      somewhat near you while they pass. Isn't that enough? It seems a little
      vague. Well, then, yes. I thought of it that way, as you say. Do you mind
      my thinking of it that way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lucia's eyes grew a little tearful, but she managed to hide it by
      settling her glasses. Seventy-five years in a small town make the opinions
      of one's neighbors part of the structure of existence. It was bitter, the
      thought that Main Street tacitly patronized her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, no, I don't mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      She dropped her knitting and laughed suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think, John," she said, "that I missed marrying a very nice man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Solley's glasses fell off with surprise. He put them on again and
      chuckled to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father used to call me a&mdash;hem&mdash;a fool. He used to state
      things more accurately than you did."
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, there was no other institute like Wimberton's. The standards of
      other places were no measure for our conduct, and the fact that such
      things were not seen elsewhere was a flattering reason why they should be
      seen in Wimberton; namely, only five beneficiaries, and one of them a rich
      man and a trustee. It was singular, but it suited Wimberton to be
      singular. One thing was plain to all, that if Mr. Solley was a
      beneficiary, then to be a beneficiary was a dignified, well-bred, and
      suitable thing. But one thing was not plain to all, why he chose to be a
      beneficiary. Babbie Cutting went up to the Institute, and coming back,
      wept for pure sentiment in her white-curtained room, with the picture on
      the wall of Sir Lancelot riding down by the whirling river, the island,
      and the gray-walled castle of Shalott.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember well the great ball and reception that Mr. Solley gave at the
      Institute to celebrate his entry, and how we all paid our respects to the
      five beneficiaries, four old men, who were gracious, but patronizing,&mdash;one
      with gold eye-glasses and gold-headed cane,&mdash;and Miss Lucia, with the
      rolled curls over her ears. The Institute, from that time on, looked down
      on Main Street with a different air, and never lost its advantage. It
      seemed to many that the second Solley had refounded it for one of those
      whims that are ornamental in the rich. Babbie Cutting said to her heart,
      "He refounded it for Miss Lucia."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nowhere in Wimberton such dignified society as at the Institute.
      Even so that the last visitor of all seemed only to come by invitation,
      and to pay his respects with proper ceremony: "Sir, or madam, I hope it is
      not an inconvenient time," or similar phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, not at all. It seems very dark around."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you take my arm? The path is steep and worn, and here is a small
      matter of a river, as you see. I regret that the water is perhaps a trifle
      cold. Yes, one hears so much talk about the other side that one hardly
      knows what to think. There is no hurry. But at this point I say good night
      and leave you. When you were young you often heard good night said when
      the morning was at hand. May it be so. Good night."

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Fourteenth
      Infantry, volunteers, were mustered out on the last day of April. Sandy
      Cass and Kid Sadler came that night into the great city of the river and
      the straits with their heads full of lurid visions which they set about
      immediately to realize. Little Irish was with them, and Bill Smith, who
      had had other names at other times. And Sandy woke the next morning in a
      room that had no furniture but a bed, a washstand, a cracked mirror, and a
      chair. He did not remember coming there. Some one must have put him to
      bed. It was not Kid Sadler or Little Irish; they were drunk early, with
      bad judgment. It must have been Bill Smith. A hat with a frayed cord lay
      on the floor. "That's Bill's hat," he said. "He's got mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      The gray morning filled the window, and carts rattled by in the street. He
      rose and drank from the pitcher to clear the bitterness from his mouth,
      and saw himself in the glass, haggard and holloweyed. It was a clean-cut
      face, with straight, thin lips, straight eyebrows, and brown hair. The
      lips were white and lines ran back from the eyes. Sandy did not think he
      looked a credit to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some of it's yellow fever," he reflected, "and some of it's jag. About
      half and half. The squire can charge it to the yellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered what new thing Squire Cass would find to say to his "rascally
      nephew, that reprobate Ulysses." Squire Cass was a red-faced gentleman and
      substantial citizen of that calm New England town of Wimberton, which
      Sandy knew very well and did not care for. It was too calm. But it would
      be good for his constitution to go there now. He wondered if his
      constitution would hold out for another night equally joyful; "Maybe it
      might;" then how much of his eighty dollars' back pay was blown in. He put
      on his clothes slowly, feeling through the pockets, collected two
      half-dollars on the way, came to the last and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must have missed one;" and began again. But that crumpled wad of bills
      was gone altogether. "Well, if I ain't an orphan!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered last a place with bright glass chandeliers, a gilt cupid
      over the bar, a girl in a frowzy hat, laughing with large teeth, and Kid
      Sadler singing that song he had made up and was so "doggone stuck on":
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      "Sandy Cass! A-alas!
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      We 'll be shut up
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      In the lockup
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      If this here keeps on."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It got monotonous, that song.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      "Sandy Cass! A-alas!
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      A comin' home,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      A bummin home&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He liked to make poetry, Kid Sadler. You would not have expected it, to
      look at his sloppy mustache, long dry throat, and big hands. The poetry
      was generally accurate. Sandy did not see any good in it, unless it was
      accurate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Little Irish is a Catholic, he come from I-er-land;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He ain't a whole cathedral, nor a new brass band;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He got religion in 'is joints from the hoonin of a shell,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An 'is auburn hair's burned bricky red from leanin over
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      hell''
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      That was accurate enough, though put in figures of speech, but the Kid was
      still more accurate regarding Bill Smith:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      "Nobody knows who Bill Smith is,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      His kin nor yet his kith,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      An nobody cares who Bill Smith is,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      An neither does Bill Smith;"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      which was perfectly true. Anyhow the Kid could not have taken the wad, nor
      Little Irish. It must have been Bill Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was Bill," he decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not make any special comments. Some thing or other happens to a man
      every day. He went down-stairs, through a dim narrow hallway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hope there don't any one want something of me. I don't believe they 'll
      get it."
    </p>
    <p>
      There were sounds in the basement, but no one met him. In the street the
      Ninth Avenue car rolled by, a block away. He saw a restaurant sign which
      said fearlessly that a stew cost ten cents, went in and breakfasted for
      fifteen, waited on by a thin, weary woman, who looked at his blue coat and
      braided hat with half-roused interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cobble-stones on Sixth Avenue were shining and wet. Here and there
      some one in the crowd turned to look after him. It might have been the
      uniform, the loafer's slouch of the hat, taken with the face being young
      and too white.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hands of the station clock stood at ten. He took a ticket to the limit
      of eighty-five cents, heard dimly the name of a familiar junction; and
      then the rumble of the train was under him for an hour. Bill Smith had
      left him his pipe and tobacco. Bill had good points. Sandy was inclined to
      think kindly of Bill's thoughtfulness, and envy him his enterprise. The
      roar of the car-wheels sounded like Kid Sadler's voice, hoarse and choky,
      "A-alas, a-alas!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was eleven o'clock at the junction. The mist of the earlier morning had
      become a slow drizzle. Trains jangled to and fro in the freight yards. He
      took a road which led away from the brick warehouses, streets of shady
      trees and lawns, and curved to the north, along the bank of a cold, sleepy
      river.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an unpainted, three-room house somewhere, where a fat woman said
      "Good land!" and gave him a plate full of different things, on a table
      covered with oil-cloth. He could not remember afterward what he ate, or
      what the woman said further. He remembered the oil-cloth, which had a
      yellow-feverish design of curved lines, that twisted snakily, and came out
      of the cloth and ran across the plate. Then out in the gray drizzle again.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the morning his brain had seemed to grow duller and duller, heavy and
      sodden; but in the afternoon red lights began dancing in the mist. It
      might have been five miles or twenty he had gone by dusk; the distinction
      between miles and rods was not clear&mdash;they both consisted of brown
      mud and gray mist. Sometimes it was a mile across the road. The dusk, and
      then the dark, heaved, and pulsed through blood-red veins, and peeled, and
      broke apart in brilliant cracks, as they used to do nights in the field
      hospital. There seemed to be no hope or desire in him, except in his feet,
      which moved on. The lights that travelled with him got mixed with lights
      on each side of a village street, and his feet walked in through a gate.
      They had no reason for it, except that the gate stood open and was painted
      white. He pushed back the door of a little garden tool-house beside the
      path, and lay down on the floor. He could not make out which of a number
      of things were happening. The Fourteenth Infantry appeared to be bucking a
      steep hill, with the smoke rolling down over it; but on the other hand Kid
      Sadler was singing hoarsely, but distinctly, "A-alas, a-alas!" and
      moreover, a dim light shone through a white-curtained window somewhere
      between a rod and a mile away, and glimmered down the wet path by the
      tool-house. Some one said, "Some of it's jag and some of it's the yellow.
      About half and half." He might have been making the remark himself, except
      that he appeared to be elsewhere. The rain kept up a thin whisper on the
      roof of the tool-house. Gasps, shouts, thumping of feet, clash of rifle
      and canteen. The hill was as steep as a wall. Little Irish said, "His legs
      was too short to shtep on the back av his neck wid the shteepness av the
      hill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A-alas! A comin' home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, shut up, Kid!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A-alas, a-alas!" The dark was split with red gashes, as it used to be in
      the field hospital. The rain whispered on the roof and the wet path
      glimmered like silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the village of Zoar, which lies far back to the west of Wyantenaug
      Valley, among low waves of hills, the house the old Hare Place, and Miss
      Elizabeth Hare and Gracia lived there behind the white gateway.
    </p>
    <p>
      That gateway had once been an ancient arch overhead, with a green wooden
      ball topping it. Some one cut a face on the ball, that leered into the
      street. It did not in the least resemble Miss Elizabeth, whose smile was
      gentle and cool; but it was taken down from its station of half a century;
      and Gracia cried secretly, because everything would needs be disconsolate
      without an arch and a proper wooden ball on top of it, under which knights
      and witch ladies might come and go, riding and floating. It seemed to
      break down the old garden life. Odd flowers would not hold conversations
      any more, tiger-lilies and peonies bother each other, the tigers being
      snappish and the peonies fat, slow, and irritating. Before Gracia's hair
      had abandoned yellow braids and become mysterious, when she learned neat
      sewing and cross-stitch, she used to set the tigers and peonies
      quarrelling to express her own feelings about neat sewing and
      cross-stitch. Afterward she found the memory of that wickedness too heavy,
      and confessed it to Miss Elizabeth, and added the knights and witch
      ladies. Miss Elizabeth had said nothing, had seemed disinclined to blame,
      and, going out into the garden, had walked to and fro restlessly, stopping
      beside the tigers and peonies, and seeming to look at the arched gateway
      with a certain wistfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Elizabeth had now a dimly faded look, the charm of a still November,
      where now and then an Indian summer steals over the chill. She wore tiny
      white caps, and her hair was singularly smooth; while Gracia's appeared
      rather to be blown back, pushed by the delicate fingers of a breeze, that
      privately admired it, away from her eager face, with its gray-blue eyes
      that looked at you as if they saw something else as well. It kept you
      guessing about that other thing, and you got no further than to wonder if
      it were not something, or some one, that you might be, or might have been,
      if you had begun at it before life had become so labelled and defined, so
      plastered over with maxims.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new gateway was still a doubtful quantity in Gracia's mind. It was not
      justified. It had no connections, no consecrations; merely a white gate
      against the greenery.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the whiteness which caught Sandy Cass's dulled eyes, so that he
      turned through, and lay down in the tool-house, and wondered which of a
      number of incongruous things was really happening: Little Irish crying
      plaintively that his legs were too short&mdash;"A-alas, a-alas!"&mdash;or
      the whisper of the rain on the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gracia lifted the white curtains, looked out, and saw the wet path
      shining.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it raining, Gracia?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It drizzles like anything, and the tool-house door is open, and, oh,
      aunty! the path shines quite down to the gate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It generally shines in the rain, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Gracia, thoughtfully. She seemed to be examining a sudden idea,
      and began the pretence of a whistle which afterward became a true fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish it wouldn't be generally, don't you? I wish things would all be
      specially."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't wi&mdash;I wouldn't whistle, if I were you," said Miss
      Elizabeth, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" Gracia came suddenly with a ripple and coo of laughter, and dropped
      on her knees by Miss Elizabeth. "You couldn't, you poor aunty, if you
      tried. You never learned, did you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Elizabeth hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I once tried to learn&mdash;of your father. I used to think it sounded
      cheerful. But my mother would n't allow it. What I really started to say
      was, that I wouldn't, if I were you, I wouldn't wish so many things to be
      other than they are. I used to wish for things to be different, and then,
      you know, when they stay quite the same, it's such a number of troubles."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gracia clasped her fingers about one knee, studied the neatly built fire
      and the blue and white tiles over it, and thought hard on the subject of
      wishes. She thought that she had not wished things to be different, so
      much as to remain the same as of old, when one wore yellow braids, and
      could whistle with approval, and everything happened specially. Because it
      is sad when you begin to suspect that the sun and moon and the growths of
      spring do not care about you, but only act according to habits they have
      fallen into, and that the shining paths, which seem to lead from beyond
      the night, are common or accidental and not meant specially. The elder
      romancers and the latest seers do insist together that they are, that such
      highways indeed as the moon lays on the water are translunary and come
      with purposes from a celestial city. The romancers have a simple faith,
      and the seers an ingenious theory about it. But the days and weeks argue
      differently. They had begun to trouble the fealty that Gracia held of
      romance, and she had not met with the theory of the seers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sandy Cass went through experiences that night which cannot be written,
      for there was no sequence in them, and they were translunary and
      sub-earthly; some of them broken fragments of his life thrown up at him
      out of a kind of smoky red pit, very much as it used to be in the field
      hospital. His life seemed to fall easily into fragments. There had not
      been much sequence in it, since he began running away from the house of
      the squire at fifteen. It had ranged between the back and front doors of
      the social structure these ten years. The squire used to storm, because it
      came natural to him to speak violently; but privately he thought Sandy no
      more than his own younger self, let loose instead of tied down. He even
      envied Sandy. He wished he would come oftener to entertain him. Sandy was
      a periodical novel continued in the next issue, an irregular and barbarous
      Odyssey, in which the squire, comparing with his Pope's translation,
      recognized Scylla and Charybdis, Cyclops and Circe, and the interference
      of the quarrelling gods. But that night the story went through the Land of
      Shadows and Red Dreams. Sandy came at last to the further edge of the
      Land; beyond was the Desert of Dreamless Sleep; and then something white
      and waving was before his eyes, and beyond was a pale green shimmer. He
      heard a gruff voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hm&mdash;Constitution, Miss Hare. That chap had a solid ancestry. He
      ought to have had a relapse and died, and he 'll be out in a week."
    </p>
    <p>
      Another voice said in an awed whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's like my Saint George!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hm&mdash;Legendary? This St. G. looks as if he'd made up with his devil.
      Looks as if they'd been tolerably good friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      A third voice remonstrated:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doctor!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hm, hm&mdash;My nonsense, Miss Gracia, my nonsense."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two ladies and the doctor went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long, low room, white, fragrant, and fresh. Soft white curtains
      waved in open windows, and outside the late sunlight drifted shyly through
      the pale green leaves of young maples. There were dainty things about,
      touches of silk and lace, blue and white china on bureau and
      dressing-table, a mirror framed with gilded pillars at the sides and a
      painted Arcadia above.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if I ain't an orphan!" grumbled Sandy, feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      An elderly woman with a checked apron brought him soup in a bowl. She was
      quite silent and soon went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's pretty slick," he thought, looking around. "I could n't have done
      better if I'd been a widow."
    </p>
    <p>
      The drifting quiet of the days that Sandy lay there pleased him for the
      time. It felt like a cool poultice on a wound. The purity and fragility of
      objects was interesting to look at, so long as he lay still and did not
      move about among them. But he wondered how people could live there right
      along. They must keep everything at a distance, with a feather-duster
      between. He had an impression that china things always broke, and white
      things became dirty. Then it occurred to him that there might be some
      whose nature, without any worry to themselves, was to keep things clean
      and not to knock them over, to touch things in a feathery manner, so that
      they did not have to stay behind a duster. This subject of speculation
      lasted him a day or two, and Miss Elizabeth and Gracia began to interest
      him as beings with that special gift. He admired any kind of capability.
      Miss Elizabeth he saw often, the woman in the checked apron till he was
      tired of her. But Gracia was only now and then a desirable and fleeting
      appearance in the doorway, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, Saint George."
    </p>
    <p>
      She never stayed to tell him why "Saint George." It came to the point that
      the notion of her yellow hair would stay by him an hour or more afterward.
      He began to wake from his dozes, fancying he heard "Good morning, Saint
      George," and finally to watch the doorway and fidget.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This lying abed," he concluded, "is played out." He got up and hunted
      about for his clothes. His knees and fingers trembled. The clothes hung in
      the closet, cleaned and pressed, in the extraordinary neighborhood of a
      white muslin dress. Sandy sat down heavily on the bed. Things seemed to be
      whizzing and whimpering all about him. He waited for them to settle, and
      pulled on his clothes gradually. At the end of an hour he thought he might
      pass on parade, and crept out into the hall and down the stairs. The
      sunlight was warm in the garden and on the porch, and pale green among the
      leaves. Gracia sat against a pillar, clasping one knee. Miss Elizabeth
      sewed; her work-basket was fitted up inside on an intricate system. Gracia
      hailed him with enthusiasm, and Miss Elizabeth remonstrated. He looked
      past Miss Elizabeth to find the yellow hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This lying abed," he said feebly, "is played out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting in the sunlight, Sandy told his story gradually from day to day.
      It was all his story, being made up of selections. He was skilful from
      practice on the squire, but he saw the need of a new principle of
      selection and combination. His style of narrative was his own. It
      possessed gravity, candor, simplicity, an assumption that nothing could be
      unreasonable or surprising which came in the course of events, that all
      things and all men were acceptable. Gracia thought that simplicity
      beautiful, that his speech was like the speech of Tanneguy du Bois, and
      that he looked like Saint George in the picture which hung in her room&mdash;a
      pale young warrior, such as painters once loved to draw, putting in those
      keen faces a peculiar manhood, tempered and edged like a sword. Sandy
      looked oddly like him, in the straight lines of brow and mouth. Saint
      George is taking a swift easy stride over the dead dragon, a kind of
      level-eyed daring and grave inquiry in his face, as if it were Sandy
      himself, about to say, "You don't happen to have another dragon? This one
      wasn't real gamy. I'd rather have an average alligator." She laughed with
      ripples and coos, and struggled with lumps in her throat, when Sandy
      through simplicity fell into pathos. It bewildered her that the funny
      things and pathetic things were so mixed up and run together, and that he
      seemed to take no notice of either of them. But she grew stern and
      indignant when Bill Smith, it was but probable, robbed the unsuspecting
      sleep of his comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see," said Sandy, apologetically, "Bill was restless, that was the
      reason. It was his enterprise kept bothering him. Likely he wanted it for
      something, and he could n't tell how much I might need without waking me
      up to ask. And he couldn't do that, because that'd have been ridiculous,
      would n't it? Of course, if he'd waked me up to ask how much I wanted,
      because he was going to take the rest with him, why, of course, I'd been
      obliged to get up and hit him, to show how ridiculous it was. Of course
      Bill saw that, and what could he do? Because there wasn't any way he could
      tell, don't you see? So he left the pipe and tobacco, and a dollar for
      luck, and lit out, being&mdash;a&mdash;restless."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Gracia wondered at and gloried in the width of that charity, that
      impersonal and untamed tolerance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Sandy took up the subject of Kid Sadler. He felt there was need of
      more virtue and valor. He took Kid Sadler and decorated him. He fitted him
      with picturesque detail. The Kid bothered him with his raucous voice,
      froth-dripped mustache, lean throat, black mighty hands, and smell of
      uncleanness. But Sandy chose him as a poet. It seemed a good start. Gracia
      surprised him by looking startled and quite tearful, where the poet says:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      "Nobody cares who Bill Smith is,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      An neither does Bill Smith;"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      which had seemed to Sandy only an accurate statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Kid's poetry needed expurgation and amendment. Sandy did it
      conscientiously, and spent hours searching for lines of similar rhyme,
      which would not glance so directly into byways and alleys that were
      surprising.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      "A comin' home,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      A roamin' home&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told the Kid," he added critically, "roamin' wasn't a good rhyme, but
      he thought it was a pathetic word."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Oh, when I was a little boy 't was things I did n't know,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An when I growed I knowed a lot of things that was n't so;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An now I know a few things that's useful an selected:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As how to put hard liquor where hard liquor is expected&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and so on, different verses, which the Kid called his "Sing Song." Sandy's
      judgment hung in doubt over this whether the lines were objectionable. He
      tempered the taste of the working literary artist for distinct flavor, and
      his own for that which is accurate, with the cautions of a village library
      committee, and decided on,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "An puts them things in moral verse to uses onexpected."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what he meant by 'onexpected,'" Sandy commented with a sense
      of helplessness, "but maybe he meant that he didn't know what he did mean.
      Because poets," getting more and more entangled, "poets are that kind they
      can take a word and mean anything in the neighborhood, or something
      that'll occur to 'em next week."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gracia admired the Kid, though Miss Elizabeth thought she ought to refer
      to him as Mr. Sadler, which seemed a pity. And she declared a violent love
      for Little Irish, because "his auburn hair turned bricky red with falling
      down a well," and because he wished to climb hills by stepping on the back
      of his neck. It was like Alice's Adventures, and especially like the White
      Knight's scheme to be over a wall by putting his head on top and standing
      on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all humors and modifications, Sandy's story was a wild and strange
      thing. It took new details from day to day, filling in the picture. To
      Gracia's imagination it spread out beyond romance, full of glooms,
      flashes, fascinations, dangers of cities, war and wilderness, and in spite
      of Sandy's self-indifference, it was he who dominated the pilgrimage,
      coloring it with his comment. The pilgrim appeared to be a person to whom
      the Valley of the Shadow of Death was equally interesting with Vanity
      Fair, and who entering the front gate of the Celestial City with rejoicing
      would presently want to know whither the back gate would take him. It
      seemed a pilgrimage to anywhere in search of everything, but Gracia began
      to fancy it was meant to lead specially to the new garden gate that opened
      so broadly on the street, and so dreamed the fancy into belief. She saw
      Sandy in imagination coming out of the pit-black night and lying down in
      the tool-house by the wet shining path. The white gate was justified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sandy's convalescence was not a finished thing, but he was beginning to
      feel energy starting within him. Energy! He knew the feeling well. It was
      something that snarled and clawed by fits.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a wildcat," he said to himself reflectively, "sitting on eggs. Why
      don't he get off? Now," as if addressing a speculative question for
      instance to Kid Sadler, "he could n't expect to hatch anything, could he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was such a question as the Kid would have been pleased with, and have
      considered justly. "Has he got the eggs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. It's a mixed figure, Kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does he feel like he wanted to hatch 'em?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What'd he do with 'em hatched? That's so, Kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Is</i> he a wildcat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is. Can a wildcat hatch eggs? No, he can't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A wildcat"&mdash;the Kid would have enjoyed following this figure&mdash;"ain't
      an incubator. There ain't enough peacefulness in him. He'd make a yaller
      mess of 'em an' take to the woods with the mess on his whiskers. It stands
      to reason, don't it? He ain't in his own hole on a chickadee's nest."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sandy stood looking over the gate into the village street, which was
      shaded to dimness by its maples, a still, warm, brooding street.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like an incubator," he thought, and heard Gracia calling from up the
      path:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Saint George!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sandy turned. She came down the path to the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aren't you going to fix the peony bed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not," said Sandy, "if you stay here by the gate."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gracia looked away from him quickly into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's warm and quiet, isn't it? It's like&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoar was not to her like anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like an incubator," said Sandy, gloomily, and Gracia looked up and
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I shouldn't have thought of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kid Sadler would have said it, if he'd been here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just his kind of figure. And he'd be saying further it was time Sandy
      Cass took to the woods."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had an irritating spasm of desire to touch the slim white fingers on
      the gate. Gracia moved her hands nervously. Sandy saw the fingers tremble,
      and swore at himself under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Saint George?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thinking he was a wildcat and he'd make a yel&mdash;a&mdash;Maybe
      thinking he didn't look nat&mdash;I mean," Sandy ended very lamely, "the
      Kid'd probably use figures of speech and mean something that'd occur to
      him by and by."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not well yet. You're not going so soon," she said, speaking quite
      low.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sandy meditated a number of lies, and concluded that he did not care for
      any of them. He seemed to dislike them as a class.
    </p>
    <p>
      This kind of internal struggle was new and irritating. He had never known
      two desires that would not compromise equably, or one of them recognize
      its place and get out of the road. The savage restlessness in his blood,
      old, well-known, expected, something in brain and bone, had always carried
      its point and always would. He accounted for all things in all men by
      reference to it, supposing them to feel restless, the inner reason why a
      man did anything. But here now was another thing, hopelessly fighting it,
      clinging, exasperating; somewhere within him it was a kind of solemn-eyed
      sorrow that looked outward and backward over his life, and behold, the
      same was a windy alkali desert that bore nothing and was bitter in the
      mouth; and at the ends of his fingers it came to a keen point, a desire to
      touch Gracia's hair and the slim fingers on the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gracia looked up and then away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not well yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've been uncommonly good to me, and all&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mustn't speak of it that way. It spoils it." It seemed to both as if
      they were swaying nearer together, a languid, mystical atmosphere
      thickening about them. Only there was the drawback with Sandy of an inward
      monitor, with a hoarse voice like Kid Sadler's, who would be talking to
      him in figures and proverbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep away from china an' lace; they break an' stain; this thing has been
      observed. Likewise is love a bit o' moonlight, sonny, that's all, an' a
      tempest, an' a sucked orange. Come out o' that, Sandy, break away; for, in
      the words o' the prophet, 'It's no square game,' an' this here girl, God
      bless her! but she plays too high, an' you can't call her, Sandy, you
      ain't got the chips. Come away, come away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that," Sandy concluded the council, "is pretty accurate. I'm broke
      this deal."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up straight and looked at Gracia with eyes drawn and narrowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt afraid and did not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't know me. If you knew me, you'd know I have to go."
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind rose in the afternoon, and blew gustily through street and
      garden. The windows of Miss Elizabeth's sitting-room were closed. The
      curtains hung in white, lifeless folds. But in Gracia's room above the
      windows were open, and the white curtains shook with the wind. Delicate
      and tremulous, they clung and moulded themselves one moment to the
      casement, and then broke out, straining in the wind that tossed the maple
      leaves and went up and away into the wild sky after the driving clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sandy turned north up the village street, walking irresolutely. It might
      be thirty miles to Wimberton. The squire had sent him money. He could
      reach the railroad and make Wimberton that night, but he did not seem to
      care about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the village, he fell into the long marching stride, and the motion
      set his blood tingling. Presently he felt better; some burden was shaken
      off; he was foot-loose and free of the open road, looking to the friction
      of event. At the end of five miles he remembered a saying of Kid Sadler's,
      chuckled over it, and began humming other verses of the "Sing Song," so
      called by the outcast poet.

    <h2>
      SANDERSON OF BACK MEADOWS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>ack Meadows lies
      three miles to the northwest of Hagar, rich bottom-lands in Sanderson
      Hollow, and the Cattle Ridge shelters it on the north. Five generations of
      Sandersons have added to the Sanderson accumulation of this world's goods,
      without sensible interference on the part of moths or rust or thieves that
      break through and steal. Cool, quiet men, slow of speech and persistent of
      mood, they prospered and lived well where other families, desiring too
      many things or not desiring anything enough, found nothing at all
      desirable and drifted away. The speculative traveller, hunting "abandoned
      farms," or studying the problem of the future of New England's outlying
      districts, who should stand on the crest of the Cattle Ridge overlooking
      the sheltered valley, would note it as an instance of the problem
      satisfactorily solved and of a farm which, so far from abandonment, smiled
      over all its comfortable expanse in the consciousness of past and
      certainty of future occupancy. These were ready illustrations for his
      thesis, if he had one: the smooth meadows, square stone walls and herds of
      fawn-colored cattle, large bams and long stables of the famous Sanderson
      stud; also the white gabled house among the maples with spreading ells on
      either side, suggesting a position taken with foresight and carefully
      guarded and secured&mdash;a house that, recognizing the uncertainties and
      drifting currents of the world, had acted accordingly, and now could
      afford to consider itself complacently. The soul of any individual
      Sanderson might be required of him, and his wisdom relative to eternity be
      demonstrated folly, but the policy of the Sanderson family had not so far
      been considered altogether an individual matter. Even individually, if the
      question of such inversion of terms ever occurred to a Sanderson, it only
      led to the conclusion that it was strictly a Pickwickian usage, and, in
      the ordinary course of language, the policy of building barns, stowing
      away goods and reflecting complacently thereon, still came under the head
      of wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cullom Sanderson, sister of Israel Sanderson of the last generation
      and married into a distant branch of the Sanderson family, carried her
      materialism with an unconscious and eccentric frankness that prevented the
      family from recognizing in her a peculiar development of its own quality.
      When Israel's gentle wife passed from a world which she had found too full
      of unanswered questions, it was Mrs. Cullom who plunged bulkily into the
      chamber of the great mystery and stopped, gulping with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I just made her some blanc-mange," she gasped. "Isn't that too bad! Why,
      Israel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Israel turned from the window and contemplated her gravely with his hands
      clasped behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you had better move down to the Meadows, Ellen," he said. "If you
      will contrive to say as little as possible to me about Marian, and one or
      two other matters I will specify, we shall get along very well."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out with slow step and bent head, followed by Mrs. Cullom trying
      vainly to find an idea on the subject suggested, which she was quite
      positive she had somewhere about her. What Israel may have thought of the
      thing that had whispered within his doors in an unknown tongue, and had
      taken away what was his without receipt or equivalent exchange, it were
      hard to say; equally hard even to say what he had thought of Marian these
      twenty years. If her cloistral devotions and visionary moods had seemed to
      him, in uninverted terms, folly, he had never said so. Certainly he had
      liked her quiet, ladylike ways, and possibly respected a difference of
      temperament inwardly as well as outwardly. At any rate, tolerance was a
      consistent Sanderson policy and philosophy of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a slight movement in the chamber, after the silence which
      followed the departing footsteps of Israel and Mrs. Cullom. A small person
      in pinafores crept stealthily from under the bed and peered over the edge.
      It was a hard climb but he persisted, and at last seated himself on it
      panting, with his elbows on his knees, gravely considering. A few hours
      since, the silent lips had whispered, among many things that came back to
      his memory in after years like a distant chime of bells, only this that
      seemed of any immediate importance: "I shall be far away to-night, Joe,
      but when you say your prayers I shall hear." The problem that puckered the
      small brow was whether prayers out of regular hours were real prayers. Joe
      decided to risk it and, getting on his knees, said over all the prayers he
      knew. Then he leaned over and patted the thin, cold cheek (Joe and his
      mother always tacitly understood each other), slid off the bed with a
      satisfied air, and solemnly trotted out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cullom Sanderson was a widow; "Which," Israel remarked, "is a pity.
      Cullom would have taken comfort in outliving you, Ellen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," remonstrated Mrs. Cullom, "I'm sure I don't know what you mean,
      Israel. I've always respected his memory."
    </p>
    <p>
      Israel, gravely regarding her, observed, "You'd better not try to train
      Joe," and departed, leaving her to struggle with the idea that between Joe
      and Cullom's comfort Israel was getting very disconnected. Disconnection
      of remark did not imply any changeableness in Israel's temperament. He
      observed a silent sequence of character, and possibly a sequence of
      thought of which he did not care to give evidence, on matters which he
      found no profit in discussing. Twelve years later the mystery again
      whispered within his doors, and he rose and followed it in his usual
      deliberate and taciturn way, without disclosing any opinion on the
      question of the inversion of terms. The story of each generation is put
      away when its time comes with a more or less irrelevant epitaph, whether
      or not its threads be gathered into a satisfactory finale. The
      Spirit-of-things-moving-on is singularly indifferent to such matters. Its
      only literary principle seems to be, to move on. The new Sanderson of Back
      Meadows grew up a slight, thin-faced young fellow. The Sanderson men were
      always slight of build, saving a certain breadth of shoulders. A drooping
      mustache in course of time hid the only un-Sanderson feature, a sensitive
      mouth. The cool gray eyes, slightly drawling speech, and deliberate manner
      were all Sanderson, indicating "a chip of the old block," as Mr. Durfey
      remarked to the old Scotchman who kept the drag store in Hagar. If the
      latter had doubts, he kept them to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sanderson stud sprang from a certain red mare, Martha, belonging to
      Blake Sanderson of Revolutionary times. They were a thin-necked, generally
      bad-tempered breed, with red veins across the eyes, of high repute among
      "horsey" men. Blake Sanderson was said to have ridden the red mare from
      Boston in some astonishingly quick time on some mysterious errand
      connected with the evacuation of New York, whereby her descendants were at
      one time known as the Courier breed; but as no one seemed to know what the
      errand was, it was possibly not a patriotic one. Three of these red,
      thinnecked mares and a stallion were on exhibition at the Hamilton County
      Fair of '76. Notable men of the county were there, mingled with turfmen of
      all shades of notoriety; several immaculately groomed gentlemen,
      tall-hatted, long-coated, and saying little, but pointed out with
      provincial awe as coming from New York and worth watching; a few lean
      Kentuckians, the redness of whose noses was in direct ratio with their
      knowledge of the business, and whose artistic profanity had a mercantile
      value in expressing contempt for Yankee horse-flesh. There was the
      Honorable Gerald and the some-say Dishonorable Morgan Map, originally
      natives of Hagar, with young Jacob Lorn between them undergoing astute
      initiation into the ways of the world and its manner of furnishing
      amusement to young men of wealth; both conversing affably with Gypsy John
      of not even doubtful reputation, at present booming Canadian stock in
      favor of certain animals that may or may not have seen Canada. Thither
      came the manager of the opera troupe resident in Hamilton during the Fair,
      and the Diva, popularly known as Mignon, a brown-haired woman with a quick
      Gallic smile and a voice, "By gad, sir, that she can soak every note of it
      in tears, the little scamp," quoth Cassidy, observing from a distance.
      Cassidy was a large fleshy man with a nickel shield under his coat.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      misquoted a tall, thin personage with an elongated face and sepulchral
      voice. "The gods made you poetical, Mr. Cassidy. Do you find your gift of
      sentiment of use on the force?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," shouted Cassidy, inadvertently touched on one of innumerable
      hobbies and beginning to pound one hand excitedly with the fist of the
      other. "In fine cases, sir, the ordinary detective slips up on just that
      point. Now let me tell you, Mr. Mavering&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me whether that is not Mignon's 'mari.' What sort of a man is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mignon's what? Oh&mdash;Manager Scott. He isn't married, further than
      that he's liable to rows on account of Mignon, who&mdash;has a face to
      upset things as you justly observe, not to speak of a disposition
      according. At least, I don't know but what they may be married. If they
      are, they're liable to perpetuate more rows than anything else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Does something smack, something grow to, has a kind of taste?"'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh?" said Cassidy, inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sanderson, standing silently by, as silently turned and walked toward the
      crowd drifting back and forth in front of the stables. Portly Judge Carter
      of Gilead, beaming through gold-rimmed glasses, side-whiskered and
      rubicund, stopped him to remark tremendously that he had issued an
      injunction against the stallion going out of the state. "A matter of local
      patriotism, Joe, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear, hear," commented the Honorable Gerald Map. A crowd began to gather
      anticipating a conference of notables. Sanderson extricated himself and
      walked on, and two small boys eventually smacked each other over the
      question whether Judge Carter was as great a man as Mr. Sanderson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mavering's eyes followed him speculatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the particular combination that troubles the manager's rest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh?" said Cassidy. "Oh, I don't know. Bob Sutton mostly. He's here
      somewhere. Swell young fellow in a plush vest, fashionable proprietor of
      thread mills."
    </p>
    <p>
      The yellow, dusty road ran between the stables and a battle line of
      sycamores and maples. Over the stables loomed the brick wall of the
      theatre, and at the end of them a small green door for the private use of
      exhibitors gave exit from the Fair Grounds. Sanderson stopped near a group
      opposite it, where Mignon stood slapping her riding-boot with her whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Sanderson," said Mignon, liquidly, "how can I get out through that
      door?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sanderson considered and suggested opening it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it's locked! Ciel! It's locked!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sanderson considered again. "Here's a key," he said hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There!" shouted the plush vest. "I knew there'd be some solution. You
      see, mademoiselle, what Ave admire in Sanderson is his readiness of
      resource. Mademoiselle refused to melt down the fence with a smile or
      climb over it on a high C, and we were quite in despair."
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the gate, in the paved courtyard between the theatre and the
      hotel, Mignon lifted her big brown eyes which said so many things,
      according to Cassidy, that were not so, and observed demurely, "If you
      were to leave me that key, Mr. Sanderson, well, I should steal in here
      after the performance tonight and ride away on the little red mare,
      certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sanderson gravely held out the key, but Mignon drew back in sudden alarm
      and clasped her hands tragically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no! You would be on guard and, what! cut up? Yes. Ah, dreadfully! You
      are so wise, Mr. Sanderson, and secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jack Mavering, following slowly after, chuckled sepulchrally to
      himself. "Pretty cool try sting. Peace to the shades of Manager Scott. I
      couldn't have done it better myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fair Grounds were as dark and lonely at eleven o'clock as if the
      lighted street were not three hundred feet away with its gossipy multitude
      going up and down seeking some new thing. The stands yawned indifferently
      from a thousand vacant seats and the race-track had forgotten its
      excitement. Horses stamped and rustled spectrally in their stalls. The
      shadow under the maples was abysmal and the abyss gave forth a murmur of
      dialogue, the sound of a silken voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," it sighed in mock despair, "but Americans, they are so very
      impassive. Look! They make love in monosyllables. They have no passion, no
      action. They pull their mustachios, say 'Damn!'&mdash;so, and it is
      tragedy. They stroke their chins, so, very grave. They say 'It is not bad,
      and it is comedy. Ah, please, Joe, be romantique!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," drawled the other voice, "I'll do whatever you like, except have
      spasms."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indifferent! Bah! That's not romantique. How would I look in the house of
      your fathers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd look like thunder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would I?" The silken voice sank low and was quiet for a moment. "Well
      then, listen. This shall you do. You shall give me that key and an order
      to your man that I ride the little mare of a Sunday morning, which is
      to-morrow, because she is the wind and because you are disagreeable. Is it
      not so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A ripple of low laughter by the green door, and "There then. You drive a
      hard bargain in love, monsieur." The door opened and she stepped with a
      rustle of skirts into and through the paved courtyard, now unlit by lamps
      at the theatre entrance, dark enough for the purposes of Manager Scott, in
      an angle of the entrance pulling his mustache and speaking after the
      manner described by Mignon as tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the valley of the Wyantenaug many stopped and listened breathlessly by
      barn-yard and entry door to a voice that floated along the still air of
      the Sabbath morning, now carolling like a bobolink, now fluting like a
      wood-thrush, now hushed in the covert of arching trees, and now pealing
      over the meadows by the river bank; others only heard a rush of hoofs and
      saw a little red horse and its rider go by with the electric stride of a
      trained racer. Each put his or her interpretation thereon, elaborately
      detailed after the manner of the region, and approximated the fact of
      Mignon and her purposes as nearly as might be expected. Delight in the
      creation of jewelled sounds as an end in itself; delight in the clear
      morning air of autumn valleys, the sight of burnished leaves and hills in
      mad revelry of color; delight in following vagrant fancies with loose
      rein, happy, wine-lipped elves that rise without reason and know no law;
      delight in the thrill and speed of a sinewy horse compact of nerves;
      however all these may have entered in the purposes of Mignon, they are not
      likely to have entered the conjectures of the inhabitants of Wyantenaug
      Valley, such pleasures of the flesh. Mignon let the mare choose her road,
      confining her own choice to odd matters of going slow or fast or not at
      all, pausing by the river bank to determine the key and imitate the
      quality of its low chuckle, and such doings; all as incomprehensible to
      the little red mare as to the inhabitants of Wyantenaug Valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The valley is broad with cup-shaped sides, save where the crowding of the
      hills has thrust one forward to stand in embarrassed projection. Some
      twenty miles above Hamilton rises Windless Mountain on the right, guarding
      from the world the village of Hagar behind it. Northward from Windless lie
      irregular hills, and between them and the long westward-inclining tumulus
      of the Cattle Ridge a narrow gorge with a tumbling brook comes down. Up
      this gorge goes a broad, well-kept road, now bridging the brook, now
      slipping under shelving ledges, everywhere carpeted with the needles of
      pines, secret with the shadows of pines, spicy and strong with the scent
      of pines, till at the end of half a mile it emerges from beneath the pines
      into Sanderson Hollow. The little red mare shot from the gloom into the
      sunlight with a snort and shake of the head that seemed to say: "Oh, my
      hoofs and fetlocks! Deliver me from a woman who makes believe to herself
      she is n't going where she is, or if she is that it's only accidental."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cullom Sanderson ponderously made ready for church, not with a mental
      preparation of which the minister would have approved unless he had seen
      as clearly as Mrs. Cullom the necessity of denouncing in unmeasured terms
      the iniquity of Susan. Susan was a maid who tried to do anything that she
      was told, and bumped her head a great deal. Her present iniquity lay in
      her fingers and consisted in tying and buttoning Mrs. Cullom and putting
      her together generally so that she felt as if she had fallen into her
      clothes from different directions. A ring at the door-bell brought Mrs.
      Cullom down from heights of sputtering invective like an exhausted
      sky-rocket, and she plumped into a chair whispering feebly, "Goodness,
      Susan, who's that?" Susan vaguely disclaimed all knowledge of "that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might find out," remonstrated Mrs. Cullom, the reaction precluding
      anything but a general feeling of injury. Susan went down-stairs and
      bumped her head on the chandelier, opened the door and bumped it on the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ouch," she remarked in a matter-of-fact tone. "Please, ma'am, Miss
      Sanderson wants to know, who's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said the trim little lady in riding-habit, "will you so kindly ask
      Miss Sanderson that I may speak to her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Cullom was already descending the stairs, each step appearing to
      Mignon to have the nature of a plunge. "My goodness, yes. Come in." Mignon
      carried her long skirt over the lintel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am quite grieved to intrude, mademoi&mdash;" Mrs. Cullom's matronly
      proportions seemed to discountenance the diminutive, "a&mdash;madame. Mr.
      Sanderson permitted me to ride one of his horses. He is so generous. And
      the horse brought me here, oh, quite decisively," and Mignon laughed such
      a soft, magical laugh that Susan grinned in broad delight. "It is such a
      famous place, this, is it not,&mdash;Back Meadows? I thought I might be
      allowed to&mdash;to pay tribute to its fame."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cullom's cordiality was such that if, strictly speaking, two hundred
      pounds can flutter, she may be said to have fluttered. She plunged through
      two sombre-curtained parlors, Mignon drifting serenely in the wake of her
      tumult. Something in the black, old colonial furniture sent a feeling of
      cold gruesomeness into her sunny veins, and she was glad when Mrs. Cullom
      declared it chilly and towed her into the dining-room, where a warm light
      sifted through yellow windows of modern setting high over a long,
      irregular sideboard, and mellowed the portraits of departed Sandersons on
      the walls: honorables numerous of colonial times (Blake, first of the
      horse-breeding Sandersons, booted and spurred but with too much thinness
      of face and length of jaw for a Squire Western type), all flanked by
      dames, with a child here and there, above or below&mdash;all but the late
      Israel, whose loneliness in his gilt frame seemed to have a certain
      harmony with his expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was Joseph's father, my brother Israel," said Mrs. Cullom, as
      Mignon's eyes travelled curiously along and rested on the last. "Joseph
      keeps his mother hung up in his den."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hung up? Den?" cried Mignon, with a recurrence of the gruesome feeling of
      the parlors. "Oh, ciel! What does he keep there? Bones?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bones! Goodness no. Books."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cullom pushed open a door to the right and entered a long, low room
      piled to the ceiling and littered with books, which, together with the
      leathern chair and red-shaded lamp before the fireplace, gave a decided
      air of studious repose, nothing suggesting a breeder of fancy stock. An
      oil painting of a lady hung over the mantel, and near it some medival
      Madonna, not unresembling the portrait in its pale cheeks, unworldly eyes,
      and that faint monastic air of vigil and vision and strenuous yearning of
      the soul to throw its dust aside. Nevertheless the face of the lady was a
      sweet face, quiet and pure, such as from many a Madonna of the Old World
      in tawdry regalia looks pityingly down over altar and winking tapers,
      seeming to say with her tender eyes, "Is it very hard, my dear, the
      living? Come apart then and rest awhile." Mignon turned to Mrs. Cullom.
      "You are dressed for going out, madame," she said, looking at that lady's
      well-to-do black silk. "Am I not detaining you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I was going to church. Goodness, are n't you going to church?" A
      sudden thought struck her and she added severely: "And you've been riding
      that wicked little mare on Sunday. And she might have thrown you, and
      how'd you look pitched headfirst into heaven dressed so everybody ud know
      you weren't going to church!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," cried Mignon, "but I was good when I was a child. Yes! I went to
      mass every day, and had a little prie-dieu, oh, so tiny!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mass!" gasped Mrs. Cullom. "Well, I declare. What's a pray-do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mignon surveyed her riding-skirt regretfully. "Would it not be
      appropriate, madame? I should so like to go with you," she said
      plaintively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Goodness! I'll risk it if you will. I'd like to see the woman who'd tell
      me what to wear to church." She plunged suddenly out of the room, leaving
      Mignon thinking that she would not like to be the woman referred to. She
      listened to the ponderous footsteps of Mrs. Cullom climbing the stairs,
      and then sank into the leathern chair facing the picture. Possibly the
      living and the dead faced each other on a point at issue; they seemed to
      debate some matter gravely and gently, as is seldom done where both are
      living. Possibly it was Mignon's dramatic instinct which caused her to
      rise at last, gathering up her riding-skirt, at the approaching footsteps
      of Mrs. Cullom, and bow with Gallic grace and diminutive stateliness to
      the pure-faced lady with the spiritual eyes. "C'est vrai, madame," she
      said, and passed out with her small head in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The congregation that day in the little church of the bended weather-vane,
      where Hagar's cross-roads meet, heard certain ancient hymns sung as never
      before in the church of the bended weather-vane. "Rock of Ages, cleft for
      me," pleaded the silken voice, like a visitant invisible, floating from
      fluted pillar to fluted pillar, calling at some unseen door, "Let me in!
      Ah, let me in!" Somewhat too much of rose leaves and purple garments in
      the voice for that simple, steadfast music. The spirit seemed pleading
      rather for gratification than rest. The congregation stopped singing, save
      Mrs. Cullom, who flatted comfortably on unnoticed. Deacon Crockett frowned
      ominously over his glasses at a scandalous scene and a woman too
      conspicuous; Captain David Brett showed all the places where he had no
      teeth; Mr. Royce looked down from the pulpit troubled with strange
      thoughts, and Miss Hettie Royce dropped her veil over her face,
      remembering her youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      How should Mignon know she was not expected to be on exhibition in that
      curious place? Of course people should be silent and listen when an artist
      sings. Mignon hardly remembered a time when she was not more or less on
      exhibition. That volatile young lady cantered along the Windless Mountain
      Road somewhat after twelve o'clock not in a very good humor. She
      recognized the ill humor, considered ill humor a thing both unpleasant and
      unnecessary and attributed it to an empty stomach; dismounted before an
      orchard and swung herself over the wall reckless of where her skirts went
      or where they did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Them apples is mine," growled a gray-bearded person behind a barn-yard
      fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why didn't you get them for me, pig?" returned Mignon sharply, and
      departed with more than her small hands could conveniently carry, leaving
      the gray-bearded person turning the question over dubiously in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened to have occurred to Sanderson that certain business of his own
      pointed to Back Meadows that Sunday morning. The up-train on Sunday does
      not leave till after eleven, and he took the valley road on the red
      stallion of uncertain temper. The inhabitants of Wyantenaug Valley heard
      no more carolling voices, or fitful rush and clatter of hoofs. The red
      stallion covered his miles with a steady stride and the rider kept his
      emotions, aesthetic or otherwise, to himself. The twain swung into the
      Hollow about eleven o'clock, and Sanderson presently found himself in his
      leathern chair debating a question at issue with the lady of the spiritual
      eyes. What passed between them is their own secret, quite hopeless of
      discovery, with one end of it on the other side of the "valley of the
      shadow," and the other buried in close coverts of Sanderson reserve. When
      the door-bell rang and Susan appearing bumped her head against the casing
      and announced, "Mr. Joe, it's a red-haired gentleman," having no dramatic
      instinct, he passed into the dining-room without salutation to the lady of
      the spiritual eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are you, Scott? Sit down," he drawled placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you know what I'm here for," said the other, with evident
      self-restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't say I do," returned Sanderson, cheerfully. "It needn't be anything
      in particular, need it?" He sat down, stretched his legs under the
      dining-room table and his arms on top of it. Manager Scott paced the floor
      nervously. Suddenly he stooped, picked up something and flung it on the
      table&mdash;a strip of thin gray veil. "You can save yourself a lie, Mr.
      Sanderson."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sanderson gravely regarded the delicate article which seemed to be put
      forth both as an accusation and a proof of something. Then he leaned
      forward and rang the bell. "I will overlook that implication for the
      present, Mr. Scott," he remarked. "If it's a bluff, it's a good one. I
      take it it is n't. Susan, has any one been here this morning?" as that
      maiden tumbled into the room in a general tangle of feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, and she's gone. My! She ain't comin' back to dinner! Lady rode
      the little mare and she went to church with Miss Sanderson."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mademoiselle Mignon," drawled Sanderson, turning to Manager Scott, "asked
      permission to ride the mare this morning. I was not aware she intended
      making an excursion to Back Meadows or I should have asked permission to
      attend her. It seems she went to Hagar with my aunt and proposes to ride
      back to Hamilton from there. It's my turn now, old man, and I'd like to
      know what was the necessity of making your visit so very tragic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I presume I'm an ass," returned the other, with a noticeable nervous
      twitching of the mouth and fingers, "and I presume I owe you an apology. I
      shall probably shoot the man that comes between Mignon and me, if he
      doesn't shoot first, which is all very asinine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite irrespective of what mademoiselle may think about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, quite."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Sanderson, after a pause, "I rather sympathize with your way
      of looking at it. I shouldn't wonder if I had some of that primeval
      brutality myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, Sanderson," said the manager. "Without going into humiliating
      details as to how I came by the fact, which I don't know why you take so
      much pains to conceal, I know as well as you do that the issue is between
      you and me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mean to threaten, do you, Scott?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no. I'm going back to Hamilton. I was looking for a row, and you
      don't give me enough to go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't do it just now, old man," said Sanderson, gently, shaking hands
      with him at the door. "I'll let you know when I can. In that case we 'll
      have it out between us."
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager strode off across the Hollow and down the Gorge to the valley
      station, and Sanderson mounted and took the road to Hagar. He passed the
      village about one. The red stallion thundered through the pine avenues at
      the foot of Windless and swept around the curve into Wyantenaug Valley,
      but it was not till within a few miles of Hamilton that the speedy little
      mare, even bothered as she was by her rider's infirmity of purpose,
      allowed herself to be overtaken. The road there turned away from the river
      and went covered with crisp autumn leaves through chestnut woods. Mignon
      looked up and laughed, and the two horses fell sympathetically into a
      walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you think you owe me an explanation?" asked Sanderson, in a low
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, sir, I owe you nothing, not even for this ride. It was paid for,"
      rippled the silken voice, and stopped suddenly in a little sob. Sanderson
      turned quickly and bent over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the living God," he said solemnly, "I swear I love you. What barrier
      is strong enough to face that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is because you do not know me, that. Listen, Joe. I have not been what
      you call good nor pure in the past and shall not in the future. No, hush.
      I know what I am and what I shall be always. If I swore by your living God
      that I loved you now, it would not mean that I should to-morrow, and the
      next day, oh, not at all. There are no deeps in me, nor what you call a
      faith or principle in life. Listen, Joe. That lady whose portrait I saw is
      your guardian angel. Look, I reverence now. To-morrow I shall mock both
      her and you. This that I speak now is only a mood. The wind is now one
      thing and then quite another, Joe. It has no centre and no soul. I am an
      artist, sir. I have moods but no character. Morals! I have none. They go
      like the whiff of the breeze. Nothing that I do lowers or lifts me. It
      passes through me and that is all. Do you not understand?" which indeed
      was hard to do, for the brown eyes were very soft and deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If any one else had told me this," said Sanderson, between his teeth,
      "man or woman, it would never have been said but once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is harder for you than for me, for to-morrow I shall not care and you,
      you will care perhaps a long time. You are fast like these hills. Listen.
      Now, sir, this is our last ride together. We are a cavalier and his lady.
      They are gallant and gay. They wear life and love and death in their hair
      like flowers. They smile and will not let their hearts be sad, for they
      say, 'It is cowardly to be sad: it is brave only to smile.' Is it not so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sanderson's New England reserve fled far away, and he bent over her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shall be as you say."
    </p>
    <p>
      And to-morrow seemed far enough away, and an hour had its eternal value.
      But the steady old hills could not understand that kind of chronology.

    <h2>
      TWO ROADS THAT MEET IN SALEM
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Salem Road is a
      dusty road. Perhaps it is not really any dustier than other roads, but it
      is straighter than most roads about Hagar. You can see more of it at a
      time, and in that way you can see more dust. Along this road one day many
      years ago came Dr. Wye of Salem in his buggy, which leaned over on one
      side; and the dust was all over the buggy-top, all over the big, gray,
      plodding horse, and all over the doctor's hat and coat. He was tired and
      drowsy, but you would not have suspected it; for he was a red-faced,
      sturdy man, with a beard cut square, as if he never compromised with
      anything. He sat up straight and solid, so as not to compromise with the
      tipping of the buggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, Billy," said the doctor, "no nonsense, now."
    </p>
    <p>
      He prided himself on being a strict man, who would put up with no
      nonsense, but every one knew better. Billy, the gray horse, knew as well
      as any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come now, Billy, get along."
    </p>
    <p>
      A tall, dusty, black-bearded man rose up beside the road, and Billy
      stopped immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      A large pack lay against the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ain't seen a yeller dog?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the doctor, gruffly. He was provoked with Billy. "There aren't
      any yellow dogs around here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He hadn't no tail," persisted the stranger, wistfully. "And there were a
      boy a-holdin' him. He chopped it off when he were little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who chopped it off?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hey? He's a little cuss, but the dog's a good dog."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get up, Billy," growled the doctor. "All boys are little cusses. I have
      n't seen any yellow dog. Nonsense! I wonder he did n't ask if I'd seen the
      tail."
    </p>
    <p>
      But somehow the doctor could not get rid of the man's face, and he found
      himself looking along the roadside for boys that were distinctly "little
      cusses" and yellow dogs without tails, all the rest of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening twilight he drove into Salem village. Very cool and
      pleasant looked the little white house among the trees. Mother Wye stood
      on the porch in her white apron and cap, watching for him. She was flying
      signals of distress&mdash;if the word were not too strong&mdash;she was
      even agitated. He tramped up the steps reassuringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," whispered Mother Wye, "you've no idea, Ned! There's a boy and a dog,
      a very large dog, my dear, on the back steps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said the doctor, gallantly, "they've no business to be anywhere
      frightening my little mother. We'll tell them to do something else." The
      doctor tramped sturdily around to the back steps, Mother Wye following
      much comforted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog was actually a yellow dog without any tail to speak of&mdash;a
      large, genial-looking dog, nevertheless; the boy, a black-eyed boy, very
      grave and indifferent, with a face somewhat thin and long. "Without
      doubt," thought the doctor, "a little cuss. Hullo," he said aloud, "I met
      a man looking for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy scrutinized him with settled gravity. "He's not much account," he
      said calmly. "I'd rather stay here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you would!" grumbled the doctor. "Must think I want somebody around
      all the time to frighten this lady. Nice folks you are, you and your dog."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy turned quickly and took off his cap. "I beg your pardon, madam,"
      he said with a smile that was singularly sudden and winning. The action
      was so elderly and sedate, so very courtly, surprising, and incongruous,
      that the doctor slapped his knee and laughed uproariously; and Mother Wye
      went through an immediate revulsion, to feel herself permeated with
      motherly desires. The boy went on unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's an easy dog, ma'am. His name's Poison, but he never does anything;"&mdash;which
      started the doctor off again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They said you wanted a boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said the doctor, growing grave, "that's true; but you're not the
      boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy seemed to think him plainly mistaken. "Stuff!" growled the doctor,
      "I want a boy I can send all around the country. I know a dozen boys that
      know the country, and that I know all about. I don't want you. Besides,"
      he added, "he said you were a little cuss."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy paid no attention to the last remark. "I'll find it out. Other
      boys are thick-headed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's true," the doctor admitted; "they are thick-headed." Indeed this
      young person's serenity and confidence quite staggered him. A new
      diplomatic idea seemed to occur to the young person. He turned to Mother
      Wye and said gravely: "Will you pull Poison's ear, ma'am, so he'll know
      it's all right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Wye, with some trepidation, pulled Poison's ear, and Poison wagged
      the whole back end of himself to make up for a tail, signifying things
      that were amicable, while the doctor tugged at his beard and objected to
      nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, young man, we'll see what you have to say for yourself. Tut! tut!
      mother,"&mdash;to Mrs. Wye's murmur of remonstrance,&mdash;"we'll have no
      nonsense. This is a practical matter;" and he tramped sturdily into the
      house, followed by the serious boy, the amicable dog, and the appeased, in
      fact the quite melted, Mother Wye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, boy," said the doctor, "what's your name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jack."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jack what? Is that other fellow your father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon maybe he is," returned Jack, with a gloomy frown. "His name's
      Baker. He peddles."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor tugged at his beard and muttered that "at any rate there
      appeared to be no nonsense about it. But he's looking for you," he said.
      "He'll take you away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's looking for the dog," said Jack, calmly. "He can't have him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The East End Road, which circles the eastern end of the Cattle Ridge, is
      not at all like the Salem Road. It is wilder and crookeder, to begin with,
      but that is a superficial matter. It passes through thick woods, dips into
      gullies, and changes continually, while along the Salem Road there is just
      the smoky haze on the meadows and dust in the chalices of the flowers;
      there too the distance blinks stupidly and speculation comes to nothing.
      But the real point is this: the Salem Road leads straight to Hagar and
      stops there; the East End Road goes over somewhere among the northern
      hills and splits up into innumerable side roads, roads that lead to
      doorways, roads that run into footpaths and dwindle away in despair, roads
      of which it must be said with sorrow that there was doubt in Salem whether
      they ever ended or led anywhere. Hence arose the tale that all things
      which were strange and new, at least all things which were to be feared,
      came into Salem over the East End Road; just as in Hagar they came down
      from the Cattle Ridge and went away to the south beyond Windless Mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along this road, a month later than the last incident, came the
      black-bearded peddler with his pack, whistling; and indeed his pack,
      though large, seemed to weigh singularly little; also the peddler seemed
      to be in a very peaceful frame of mind. And along this road too came the
      plodding gray horse, with the serious boy driving, and the yellow dog in
      the rear; all at a pace which slowly but surely overtook the peddler. The
      peddler, reaching a quiet place where a bank of ferns bordered the
      brushwood, sat down and waited, whistling. The dog, catching sight of him,
      came forward with a rush, wagging the back end of himself; and Billy, the
      gray horse, came gently to a standstill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How goes it?" said the peddler, pausing a moment in his whistling.
      "Pretty good?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mostly."
    </p>
    <p>
      The peddler took a cigar-case from his pocket, a cigar wrapped in tin-foil
      from the case, and lay back lazily among the ferns, putting his long thin
      hands behind his head. "My notion was," he murmured, "that it would take a
      month, a month would be enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      The serious boy said nothing, but sat with his chin on his fists looking
      down the road meditatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My notion was," went on the peddler, "that a doctor's boy, particularly
      that doctor's boy, would get into all the best houses around&mdash;learn
      the lay of things tolerably neat. That was my notion. Good notion, wasn't
      it, Jack?" Jack muttered a subdued assent. The peddler glanced at him
      critically. "For instance now, that big square house on the hill north of
      Hagar."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack shook his head. "Nothing in it. Old man, name Map, rich enough,
      furniture done up in cloth, valuables stored in Hamilton; clock or two
      maybe; nothing in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said the other, "just so;" and again he glanced critically through
      his half-closed eyes. "But there are others." Again Jack muttered a
      subdued assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      The apparent peddler smoked, quite at his ease among the ferns, and seemed
      resolved that the boy should break the silence next.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you banking on this business, dad?" said the latter, finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah&mdash;why, no, Jack, not really. It's a sort of notion, I admit." He
      lifted one knee lazily over the other. "I'm not shoving you, Jack. State
      the case." A long silence followed, to which the conversation of the two
      seemed well accustomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never knew anything like that down there," nodding in the direction of
      Salem. "Those people.&mdash;It's different."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so," assented the apparent peddler, critically. "I reckon it is.
      We make a point not to be low. Polish is our strong point, Jack. But we're
      not in society. We are not, in a way, on speaking terms with society."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It ain't that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't," corrected the other, gently. "Isn't, Jack. But I rather think it
      is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Jack, "it's different, and"&mdash;with gloomy decision&mdash;"it's
      better."
    </p>
    <p>
      The apparent peddler whistled no more, but lay back among the ferns and
      gazed up at the drooping leaves overhead. The gray horse whisked at the
      wood-gnats and looked around now and again inquiringly. The yellow dog
      cocked his head on one side as if he had an opinion worth listening to if
      it were only called for.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose now," said the apparent peddler, softly, "I suppose now they're
      pretty cosy. I suppose they say prayers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bet.".
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean that they do, Jack. I suppose," he went on dreamily, "I suppose
      the old lady has white hair and knits stockings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She does that," said Jack, enthusiastically, "and pincushions and mats."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And pincushions and mats. That's so."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lowing of cattle came up to them from hidden meadows below; for the
      afternoon was drawing near its close and the cattle were uneasy. The
      chimney and roof of a farmhouse were just visible through a break in the
      sloping woods. The smoke that mounted from the chimney seemed to linger
      lovingly over the roof, like a symbol of peace, blessing the hearth from
      which it came. The sentimental outcast puffed his excellent cigar
      meditatively, now and again taking it out to remark, "Pincushions and
      mats!" indicating the constancy of his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The serious boy motioned in the direction of Salem. "I think I'll stay
      there," he said. "It's better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon I know how you feel, Jack,&mdash;know how you feel. Give me my
      lowly thatched cottage, and that sort of thing." After a longer silence
      still, he sat up and threw away his cigar. "Well, Jack, if you see your
      way&mdash;a&mdash;if I were you, Jack," he said slowly, "I wouldn't go
      half and half; I'd go the whole bill. I'd turn on the hose and inquire for
      the ten commandments, that's what I'd do." He came and leaned lazily on
      the carriage wheel. "That isn't very plain. It's like this. You don't
      exactly abolish the old man; you just imagine him comfortably buried;
      that's it, comfortably buried, with an epitaph,&mdash;flourishy, Jack,
      flourishy, stating"&mdash;here his eyes roamed meditatively along Billy's
      well-padded spine&mdash;"stating, in a general way, that he made a point
      of polish."
    </p>
    <p>
      The serious boy's lip trembled slightly. He seemed to be seeking some
      method of expression. Finally he said: "I'll trade knives with you, dad.
      It's six blades"; and the two silently exchanged knives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Billy, the gray horse, plodded down the hill through the woods, and
      the apparent peddler plodded up. At one turn in the road can be seen the
      white houses of Salem across the valley; and here he paused, leaning on
      the single pole that guarded the edge. After a time he roused himself
      again, swung his pack to his shoulder, and disappeared over the crest of
      the hill whistling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shadows deepened swiftly in the woods; they lengthened in the open
      valley, filling the hollows, climbed the hill to Salem, and made dusky Dr.
      Wye's little porch and his tiny office duskier still. The office was so
      tiny that portly Judge Carter of Gilead seemed nearly to fill it, leaving
      small space for the doctor. For this or some other reason the doctor
      seemed uncomfortable, quite oppressed and borne down, and remonstrating
      with the oppression. The judge was a man of some splendor, with gold
      eye-glasses and cane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There really is no doubt about it," he was saying, with a magnificent
      finger on the doctor's knee, "no doubt at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation seemed to be most absorbing. The doctor pulled his beard
      abstractedly and frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The serious boy drove by outside in the dusk, and after a while came up
      from the bam. He sat down on the edge of the porch to think things over,
      and the judge's voice rolled on oracularly. Jack hardly knew yet what his
      thoughts were; and this was a state of mind that he was not accustomed to
      put up with, because muddle-headedness was a thing that he especially
      despised. "You don't exactly abolish the old man," he kept hearing the
      peddler say; "you just imagine him comfortably buried&mdash;with an
      epitaph&mdash;flourishy&mdash;stating&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clever, very," said the judge. "Merriwether was telling me&mdash;won't
      catch him, too clever&mdash;Merri-wether says&mdash;remarkable&mdash;interesting
      scamp, very." The doctor growled some inaudible objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did he show himself!" exclaimed the judge. "Why, see here. Observe
      the refined cleverness of it! It roused your interest, didn't it? It was
      unique, amusing. Chances are ten to one you would n't have taken the boy
      without it. Why, look here&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stuff!"&mdash;Here the doctor raised his voice angrily. "The boy ran away
      from him, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe, doctor, maybe," said the judge, soothingly. "But there are other
      things&mdash;looks shady&mdash;consider the man is known. Dangerous,
      doctor, dangerous, very. You ought to be careful." Then the words were a
      mere murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack sat still on the porch, with his chin on his hands. Overhead the
      night-hawks called, and now and then one came down with a whiz of swooping
      wings. Presently he heard the chairs scrape; he rose, slipped around to
      the back porch and into the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little bronze clock in the dining-room had just told its largest stint
      of hours,&mdash;and very hard work it made of it. It was a great trial to
      the clock to have to rouse itself and bluster so. It did not mind telling
      time in a quiet way. But then, every profession has its trials. It settled
      itself again to stare with round, astonished face at the table in the
      centre of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack sat at the table by a dim lamp, the house dark and silent all around
      him, writing a letter. He leaned his head down almost on a level with the
      paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I herd him and you," he wrote in a round hand with many blots. "I lied
      and so did he I mean dad. I can lie good. Dad sed I must learn the ten
      comandments. The ten comandments says diferent things. You neednt be
      afrad. There dont anithing happen cep to me. I do love Mother Wye tru."
      The clock went on telling the time in the way that it liked to do,
      tick-tick-tick. Overhead the doctor slept a troubled sleep, and in Gilead
      Judge Carter slept a sound sleep of good digestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far off the Salem Road led westward straight to Hagar, and stopped, and
      the moonlight lay over it all the way; but the East End Road led through
      the shadows and deep night over among the northern hills, and split up
      into many roads, some of which did not seem ever to end, or lead anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack dropped from the window skilfully, noiselessly, and slid away in the
      moonlight. At the Corners he did not hesitate, but took the East End Road.

    <h2>
      A VISIBLE JUDGMENT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>e bore the name of
      Adam Wick. There seemed to be something primitive in his temperament to
      fit it. By primitive we mean of such times as may have furnished
      single-eyed passions that did not argue. He was a small, thin, stooping
      man, with a sharp nose and red-lidded eyes. Sarah Wick, his daughter, was
      a dry-faced woman of thirty, and lived with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His house stood on a hill looking over the village of Preston Plains,
      which lay in a flat valley. In the middle of the village the
      church-steeple shot up tapering and tall.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bickering community. The church was a centre of interest. The
      outlines of the building were clean and shapely, but in detail it stood
      for a variety of opinions. A raised tracery ran along the pseudo-classic
      frieze of its front, representing a rope of flowers with little cupids
      holding up the loops. They may have been cherubs. The community had
      quarrelled about them long ago when the church was building, but that
      subject had given way to other subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The choir gallery bulged over the rear seats, as if to dispute the
      relative importance of the pulpit. That was nothing. But it needed
      bracing. The committee decided against a single pillar, and erected two,
      one of them in the middle of Adam Wick's pew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam looked at things simply. It seemed to his simplicity that the
      community had conspired to do him injustice. The spirit of nonconformity
      stirred within him. He went to the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Andrew Hill, nor any other man, nor committeeman's got no rights in my
      pew."
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister was dignified.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The pew, Mr. Wick, belongs to the church."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No such thing! I sat twenty-four years in that pew."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that, though very creditable&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No such thing! I'll have no post in my pew, for Andrew Hill nor no
      minister neither."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Wick&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You take that post out o' my pew."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stumped out of the minister's green-latticed doorway and down the
      gravel path. His eyes on either side of his sharp nose were like those of
      an angry hawk, and his stooping shoulders, seen from behind, resembled the
      huddled back of the hawk, caged and sullen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister watched him. Properly speaking, a primitive nature is an
      unlimited monarchy where ego is king, but the minister's reflections did
      not run in these terms. He did not even go so far as to wonder whether
      such primitive natures did not render the current theory of a church
      inaccurate. He went so far as to wonder what Adam Wick would do.
    </p>
    <p>
      One dark, windy night, near midnight, Adam Wick climbed in at the
      vestibule window of the church, and chopped the pillar in two with an axe.
      The wind wailed in the belfry over his head. The blinds strained, as if
      hands were plucking at them from without. The sound of his blows echoed in
      the cold, empty building, as if some personal devil were enjoying the
      sacrilege. Adam was a simple-minded man; he realized that he was having a
      good time himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was three days before the church was opened. What may have been Adam's
      primitive thoughts, moving secretively among his townsmen? Then a sudden
      rumor ran, a cry went up, of horror, of accusation, of the lust of strife.
      Before the accusation Adam did not hesitate to make his defiance perfect.
      The primitive mind was not in doubt. With a blink of his red eyelids, he
      answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You tell Andrew Hill, don't you put another post in my pew."
    </p>
    <p>
      A meeting was held; a majority voted enthusiastically to strike his name
      from the rolls for unchristian behavior and to replace the pillar. A
      minority declared him a wronged man. That was natural enough in Preston
      Plains. But Adam Wick's actions at this point were thought original and
      effective by every one.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat silently through the proceedings in the pew with the hacked pillar,
      his shoulders hunched, his sharp eyes restless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Wick," said the minister, sternly, "have you anything to say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I put fifty-six dollars into this meetin'-house. Any man deny that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No man denied it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph!" said Adam.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the hymn-book from the rack, lifted the green cushion from the
      seat, threw it over his shoulder, and walked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      No man spoke against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no further business before this meeting," said Chairman Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a Sunday in August and nearly noon. From the side porch of Adam
      Wick's house on the hill the clustered foliage of the village below was
      the centre of the landscape. The steeple and ridgepole of the church rose
      out of the centre of the foliage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landscape could not be fancied without the steeple. The dumb materials
      of the earth, as well as the men who walk upon it, acquire habits. You
      could read on the flat face of the valley that it had grown accustomed to
      Preston Plains steeple.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the side porch stood a long, high-backed bench. It was a close
      imitation of the pews in the church below among the foliage, with the long
      green cushion on the seat and a chair facing it with a hymn-book on it.
      Adam sat motionless on the bench. His red-lidded eyes were fixed intently
      on the steeple.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hen with a brood of downy yellow chickens pecked about the path. A
      turkey strutted up and down. The air was sultry, oppressive. A low murmur
      of thunder mingled with the sleepy noises of creaking crickets and
      clucking hen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam Wick's bench and rule of Sabbath observance had been common talk in
      Preston Plains. But it had grown too familiar, for subjects of dispute
      ever gave way there to other subjects. Some one said it was pathetic. The
      minority thought it a happy instance to throw in the face of the bigoted
      majority, that they had driven from the church a man of religious feeling.
      The minister had consulted Andrew Hill, that thick-set man with the dry
      mouth and gray chin-beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not take out that pillar!" said Andrew Hill. "Ah," said the minister,
      "I'm afraid that wouldn't do. It would seem like&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't move that pillar if the whole town was sidin' with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, now&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not while I'm alive. Adam Wick, he's obstinate." Mr. Hill shut his mouth
      grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Religious! Humph! Maybe he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister moved away. They were a stiff-necked people, but after all he
      felt himself to be one of them. It was his own race. He knew how Andrew
      Hill felt, as if something somewhere within him were suddenly clamped down
      and riveted. He understood Adam too, in his private pew on the side porch,
      the hymn-book on the chair, his eyes on Preston Plains steeple, fixed and
      glittering. He thought, "We don't claim to be altogether lovely."
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam was in his own eyes without question a just man suffering injustice.
      His fathers in their Genesis and Exodus had so suffered, faced stocks,
      pillory, the frowning edge of the wilderness, and possessed their souls
      with the same grim congratulation. No generation ever saw visions and
      sweat blood, and left a moderate-minded posterity. Such martyrs were not
      surer that the God of Justice stood beside them than Adam was sure of the
      injustice of that pillar in that pew, nor more resolved that neither death
      nor hell should prevail against the faithfulness of their protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the turkey strutted in the yard, the chickens hurried and peeped, the
      thunder muttered at intervals as if the earth were breathing heavily in
      its hot sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church-bell rang for the end of the morning service. It floated up
      from the distance, sweet and plaintive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam rose and carried the cushion, chair, and hymn-book into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm was rising, darkening. It crouched on the hills. It seemed to
      gather its garments and gird its loins, to breathe heavily with crowded
      hate, to strike with daggers of lightning right and left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam came out again and sat on the bench. The service being over, it was
      no longer a pew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carriages, one after another, drove out of the foliage below, and along
      the five roads that ran out of Preston Plains between zigzag fences and
      low stone walls. They were hurrying, but from that distance they seemed to
      crawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Wick carriage came up the hill and through the gate&mdash;creaking
      wheels, a shambling white horse, Sarah jerking the reins with monotonous
      persistence. She stepped down and dusted off her cotton gloves. Adam
      walked out to take the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wherefore do ye harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened
      their hearts?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam seemed puzzled, blinked his eyes, seemed to study carefully the
      contents of his own mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do' know," he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "First Samuel, seven, six," said Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam led the horse away despondently. Halfway to the bam he stopped and
      called out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he preach at me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister had chosen a text that Adam did not know, and made no
      reference to him, although the text was a likely one. Adam felt both
      slights in a dim way, and resented them. He came back to the house and sat
      in the front room before the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The valley was covered with a thick veil of gray rain. The black cloud
      above it cracked every moment with sudden explosions, the echoes of them
      tumbling clumsily among the hills. Preston Plains steeple faded away and
      the foliage below it became a dim blot. A few drops struck the window-pane
      at Adam's face, then a rush and tumult of rain. Dimmer still the valley,
      but the lightning jabbed down into it incessantly, unseen batteries
      playing attack and defence over Preston Plains steeple.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a swift, sudden storm, come and gone like a burst of passion. The
      imminent crack and crash of the thunder ceased, and only rumblings were
      heard, mere memories, echoes, or as if the broken fragments of the sky
      were rolling to and fro in some vast sea-wash. The valley and the village
      trees came slowly into view.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dinner's ready," said Sarah, in the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a strident voice, and said dinner was ready as if she expected
      Adam to dispute it. There was no answer from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pa! Aren't you comin'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer. Sarah came to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pa!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His face was close to the rain-washed window-pane. Something rattled in
      his throat. It seemed like a suppressed chuckle. He rested his chin on his
      hand and clawed it with bony fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pa!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned on her sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You needn't be shoutin' on the Lord's day. Meetin'-house steeple's
      a-fire."
    </p>
    <p>
      From Adam Wick's nothing could be seen but the slow column of smoke rising
      and curling around the slender steeple. But under the foliage Preston
      Plains was in tumult.
    </p>
    <p>
      By night the church was saved, but the belfry was a blackened ruin within.
      The bell had fallen, through floor, cross-beams, and ceiling, and smashed
      the front of the choir gallery, a mass of fallen pillar, railing, and
      broken plaster on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrew Hill called a meeting. Adam Wick came, entered his cluttered pew
      and sat on the pillar that lay prostrate across it. He perched on it like
      a hawk, with huddled back and red-lidded eyes blinking. It was the sense
      of the meeting that modern ideas demanded the choir should sit behind the
      minister. The ruined gallery must be removed. Adam Wick rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've got no place in this meetin'," said Andrew Hill. "Set down."
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam kept his place scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't I subscribe twenty dollars to this church?" The chairman stroked
      his beard and a gleam of acrid humor lit his face for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said slowly, "I suppose you can."
    </p>
    <p>
      And the eyes of all present looked on Adam Wick favorably.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister rose to speak the last word of peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friends, the Lord did it. He is righteous&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's my idea!" said Adam Wick, like a hawk on his fallen pillar,
      red-lidded, complacent. "He did what was right."
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister coughed, hesitated, and sat down. Andrew Hill glowered from
      his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no further business before this meetin'."

      THE EMIGRANT EAST
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he old book-shop
      on Cripple Street in the city of Hamilton was walled to its dusky ceiling
      with books. Books were stacked on the floor like split wood, with alleys
      between. The long table down the centre was piled with old magazines and
      the wrecks of paper-covered novels. School arithmetics and dead
      theologies; Annuals in faded gilt, called "Keepsake," or "Friendship's
      Offering"; little leathern nubbins of books from the last century, that
      yet seemed less antique than the Annuals which counted no more than forty
      years&mdash;so southern and early-passing was the youth of the Annual;
      Bohn's translations, the useful and despised; gaudy, glittering prints of
      the poets and novelists; all were crowded together without recognition of
      caste, in a common Bohemia. Finding a book in that mystical chaos seemed
      to establish a right to it of first discovery. The pretty girl, who sat in
      one of the dim windows and kept the accounts, looked Oriental but not
      Jewish, and wore crimson ribbons in her black hair and at her throat. She
      read one of the Annuals, or gazed through the window at Cripple Street. A
      show-case in the other window contained stamp collections, Hindoo,
      Chinese, and Levantine coinage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far back in the shop a daring explorer might come upon a third window,
      gray, grimy, beyond which lay the unnamable backyards between Cripple and
      Academy Streets. It could not be said to "open on" them, for it was never
      opened, or "give a view" of them, being thick with gray dust. But if one
      went up to it and looked carefully, there in the dim corner might be seen
      an old man with a long faded black coat, rabbinical beard, dusky,
      transparent skin, and Buddha eyes, blue, faint, far away, self-abnegating,
      such as under the Bo-tree might have looked forth in meek abstraction on
      the infinities and perceived the Eightfold Principle. It was always
      possible to find Mr. Barria by steering for the window. So appeared the
      old bookshop on Cripple Street, Mr. Barria, the dealer, and his
      granddaughter, Janey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nature made Cripple Street to be calm and dull; for the hand of man,
      working through generations, is the hand of nature, as surely as in nature
      the oriole builds its nest or the rootlets seek their proper soil. Cripple
      Street ran from Coronet to Main Street and its paving was bad. There were
      a few tailors and bookbinders, a few silent, clapboarded houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      But two doors from the corner on Coronet Street stood Station No. 4, of
      the Fire Brigade, and Cripple Street was the nearest way to Main Street,
      whither No. 4 was more likely to be called than elsewhere. So that, though
      nature made Cripple Street to be calm and dull, No. 4, Fire Brigade,
      sometimes passed it, engine, ladder, and hose, in the splendor of the
      supernatural, the stormy pageantry of the gods; and one Tommy Durdo drove
      the engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Durdo first came into Mr. Barria's shop in search of a paper-covered novel
      with a title promising something wild and belligerent. It was a rainy,
      dismal day, and Janey sat among the dust and refuse of forgotten
      centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My eyes!" he thought. "She's a peach."
    </p>
    <p>
      He lost interest in any possible belligerent novel, gazed at her with the
      candor of his youthfulness, and remarked, guilefully:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I bet you've seen me before now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You drive the engine," said Janey, with shining eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, this is my pie," thought Durdo, and sat down by her on a pile of old
      magazines. He was lank, muscular, with a wide mouth, lean jaws, turn-up
      nose, and joyful eyes. The magazines contained variations on the loves of
      Edwards, Eleanors, and other people, well-bred, unfortunate, and possessed
      of sentiments. Durdo was not well-bred, and had not a presentable
      sentiment in his recollection. He had faith in his average luck, and went
      away from Mr. Barria's shop at last with a spot in the tough texture of
      his soul that felt mellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "J. Barria, bookdealer," he read from the sign. "J! That's Janey, ain't
      it? Hold on. She ain't the bookdealer. She ain't any ten-cent novel
      either. She's a Rushy bound, two dollar and a half a copy, with a
      dedication on the fly-leaf, which"&mdash;Tommy stopped suddenly and
      reflected&mdash;"which it might be dedicated to Tommy."
    </p>
    <p>
      It came near to being a sentiment. The possibility of such a thing rising
      from within him seemed impressive. He walked back to No. 4 thoughtfully,
      and thrust himself into a fight with Hamp Sharkey, in which it was proved
      that Hamp was the better man. Tommy regained his ordinary reckless
      cheerfulness. But when a man is in a state of mind that it needs a
      stand-up and knock-down fight to introduce cheerfulness, he cannot hope to
      conceal his state of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cripple Street drowsed in the sunshine one August afternoon. A small boy
      dug bricks out of the sidewalk with a stick. It seemed to emphasize the
      indifferent calm that no one took that interest in Cripple Street to come
      and stop him. The clangor of the fire-bells broke across the city. For a
      moment the silence in Cripple Street seemed more deathly than before. Then
      the doors of the tailors and bookbinders flew open. The Fire Company came
      with leap and roar, ladder, engine, and hose, rattle of wheels and thud of
      steam. Passing Mr. Barria's Durdo turned his head, saw Janey in the door,
      and beamed on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hooray," he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's Tommy's girl," thundered Hamp Sharkey, from the top of his jingling
      ladders. Fire Brigade No. 4 cheered, waved its helmet, wherever it had a
      hand free, and in a moment was gone, leaving the drift of its smoke in the
      air, the tremble of its passing, and Janey flushed and thrilled. Hook and
      ladder and all had hailed her with honor as Tommy's girl. A battalion of
      cavalry, with her lover at the head, dashing up to salute, say, her
      battlemented or rose-embowered window&mdash;both terms occur in the
      Annuals&mdash;and galloping away to the wars, might have been better
      theoretically, but Janey was satisfied. She had no defence against such
      battery. Power, daring, and danger were personified in Tommy. He had
      brought them all to her feet. This it was to live and be a woman. She
      turned back into the dim shop, her eyes shining. The backs of the dusty
      books seemed to quiver and glow, even those containing arithmetic, dead
      philosophies, and other cool abstractions, as if they forgot their figures
      and rounded periods, and thought of the men who wrote them, how these once
      were young.
    </p>
    <p>
      Durdo found it possible, by spending his off hours in Mr. Barria's shop,
      to keep cheerful without fighting Hamp Sharkey. A row now and then with a
      smaller man than Hamp was enough to satisfy the growing mellowness of his
      soul. His off hours began at four. He passed them among the Annuals and
      old magazines in a state of puzzled and flattered bliss. He fell so far
      from nature as to read the Annuals where Janey directed, to conclude that
      what was popularly called "fun" was vanity and dust in the mouth; that
      from now on he would be decent, and that any corner or hole in the ground
      which contained Janey and Tommy would suit him forever. No doubt he was
      wrong there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barria's memories of all that had befallen him within or without, in
      the journey of this life, before his entry on the Path of Quietness, and
      his consciousness of all external objects and occurrences since, were
      clear enough, but only as little white clouds in the open sky are clear,
      whose business it is to be far away and trouble us with no insistent
      tempest. They never entered the inner circle of his meditation. They
      appeared to be distant things. He had no sense of contact with them. His
      abstractions had formed a series of concentric spheres about him. In some
      outer sphere lay a knowledge of the value of books as bought and sold,
      which enabled him to buy and sell them with indifferent profit, but it
      entered his central absorption no more than the putting on and off of his
      coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not absorbed in books. He did not seem to care for them, beyond the
      fourscore or more worn volumes that were piled about his table by the gray
      window, many of them in tattered paper covers bearing German imprints,
      some lately rebound by a Cripple Street bookbinder. He did not care for
      history or geography, not even his own. He did not care where he was born
      or when, where he was now, or how old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once&mdash;whether forty years gone or four hundred, would have seemed to
      him a question of the vaguest import&mdash;he had taught Arabic and Greek
      in a university town, which looks off to mountains that in their turn look
      off to the Adriatic Sea. There was a child, a smaller Julian Barria.
      Somewhere about this time and place he began explorations in more distant
      Eastern languages. The date was unnoted, obscure, traditional. The
      interest in language soon disappeared. It was a period of wonder and
      searching. After the moral fierceness of the Arab and Mohammedan, the
      Hindoo's and Buddhist's calm negations and wide mental spaces first
      interested him by contrast, then absorbed him. He began to practise the
      discipline, the intense and quiet centring on one point, till the sense of
      personality should slip away and he and that point be one. There was no
      conviction or conversion, for the question never seemed put to him, or to
      be of any value, whether one thing was true and another not true. But the
      interest gradually changed to a personal issue. All that he now heard and
      saw and spoke to, objects in rest or in motion, duties that called for his
      performance, became not so much vaguer in outline as more remote in
      position. In comparison with his other experiences they were touched with
      a faint sense of unreality. The faces of other men were changed in his
      eyes. He sometimes noticed and wondered, passingly, that they seemed to
      see no change in him, or if any change, it was one that drew them more
      than formerly to seek his sympathy. He observed himself listening to
      intimate confessions with a feeling of patient benevolence that cost him
      no effort, and seemed to him something not quite belonging to him as a
      personal virtue, but which apparently satisfied and quieted the troubled
      souls that sought him.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this later time&mdash;a reference to the histories would fix the
      date at 1848&mdash;a civil war swept the land, and the University was
      closed. The younger Julian Barria was involved in the fall of the
      revolutionists and fled from the country. The late teacher of Greek and
      Arabic crossed the ocean with him. It was a matter of mild indifference.
      He gave his sympathy to all, gently and naturally, but felt no mental
      disturbance. Neither did the change of scene affect him. Everywhere were
      earth beneath and sky above, and if not it were no matter. Everywhere were
      men and women and children, busy with a multitude of little things,
      trembling, hurrying, crying out among anxieties. It was all one, clear
      enough, but remote, touched with the same sense of unreality, and like
      some sad old song familiar in childhood and still lingering in the memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book-shop on Cripple Street at one time dealt also in newspapers and
      cigars. They were more to the younger Barria's talent, more to his taste
      the stirring talk of men who live in their own era and congregate wherever
      there are newspapers and tobacco. Afterward he went away into the West,
      seeking a larger field for his enterprise than Cripple Street, and the
      newspaper and cigar business declined and passed away. The show-case fell
      to other uses. The elder Barria sat by the square rear window, and the
      gray dust gathered and dimmed it. Ten years flowed like an unruffled
      stream; of their conventional divisions and succeeding events he seemed
      but superficially conscious. Letters came now and then from the West,
      announcing young Barria's journeys and schemes, his marriage in the course
      of enterprise, finally his death. The last was in a sprawling hand, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jules missus is ded to an thars a kid. Jules sez take her to the ol man
      Jake when ye go est in the spring. I am Jake. He is wooly in his hed sez
      he but he is a good man sez he. He got a soul like Mondays washin on
      Tewsday mornin sez he spekin in figgers an menin you. Them was Jules last
      word."
    </p>
    <p>
      The large, bony person called Jake, slouch-hatted and rough-bearded,
      brought the child in time, and departed, muttering embarrassment. She
      stood among the Annuals and old magazines with a silver dollar from Jake
      clasped in each hand, and a roll of fifty-dollar bills in her tiny pocket,
      probably representing young Barria's estate and the end of Jake's duties
      as executor. She might have been two or three years old. That was not a
      matter of interest to Mr. Barria, in whose conception the soul of every
      creature was, in a way, more ancient than the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to believe in his good intentions and came to him gravely. She
      did not remember any mother, and for her own name it had apparently been
      "chicken" when her father had wanted her, and "scat" when he did not. Mr.
      Barria envied a mind so untrammelled with memories, and named her Jhana,
      which means a state of mystical meditation, of fruitful tranquillity, out
      of which are said to come six kinds of supernatural wisdom and ten powers.
      The name sometimes appeared to him written Dhyana, when his meditations
      ran in Sanskrit instead of Pali. Cripple Street called her Janey, and
      avoided the question with a wisdom of its own. It had grown used to Mr.
      Barria. Scholars came from near-by universities to consult him, and
      letters from distant countries to Herr, Monsieur, or Signor Doctor Julian
      Barria, but Cripple Street, if it knew of the matter, had no stated theory
      to explain it and was little curious. His hair and beard grew white and
      prophetic, his skin more transparent. A second decade and half a third
      glided by, and Janey and Tommy Durdo sat hand in hand among the Annuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must ask him, Tommy," Janey insisted, "because lovers always ask
      parents."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' the parents is horty and they runs away hossback. Say, Janey, if his
      whiskers gets horty, I 'll faint. Say, Janey, you got to go 'n ask my ma
      if you can have me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would she be haughty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Janey always bubbled with pleasure, like a meadow spring, when Tommy "got
      on a string," as he called it, fell to jesting circumstantially. "You bet.
      She'd trun you down. An' yet she's married second time, she has," he went
      on, thoughtfully, "an' she didn't ask my consent, not either time. I would
      n't a given it the first, if she had, 'cause dad was no good. I'd a been
      horty. I'd a told her he wa'n't worthy to come into any family where I was
      comin', which he wa'n't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Tommy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yep. Dad was more nuisance'n mosquitoes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barria came out of the distant retreat of his meditation slowly, and
      looked up. It did not need all the subtle instinct of a pundit to read the
      meaning of the two standing hand in hand before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tommy looked and felt as one asking favors of a spectre, and Mr. Barria
      had fallen into a silent habit of understanding people.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Little Jhana iss a woman so soon?" he said softly. "She asks of her
      birthright."
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and looked quietly, steadily at Tommy, who felt himself growing
      smaller inside, till his shoes seemed enormous, even his scalp loose and
      his skull empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr.&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's Tommy Durdo," said Janey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will always remember to be a little kinder than seems necessary, Mr.
      Durdo? It iss a good rule and very old."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He didn't ask whether I was a burglar or a lunatic by profesh," grumbled
      Tommy, later. "Ain't a reasonable interest. He might a asked which."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind," said Janey. "I'll tell that."
    </p>
    <p>
      There were four rooms over the shop, where the three lived in great peace.
      Tommy never made out whether Mr. Barria thought him a burglar or a
      lunatic. As regards Janey he felt more like a burglar, as regards Mr.
      Barria more like a lunatic. He dodged him reverentially. Only at the
      station, where his duties kept him for the most part, did he feel like a
      natural person and a fireman. He confided in Hamp Sharkey, and brought him
      to the shop and the little up-stairs sitting-room for the purpose of
      illustration. Hamp's feelings resembled Tommy's. They fell into nave
      sympathy. Hamp admired Tommy for his cleverness, his limber tongue, the
      reckless daring of his daily contact with Mr. Barria and Janey, two
      mysteries, differing but both remote. She was not like the shop-girls on
      Main Street. Hamp would carry away the memory of her shining eyes lifted
      to Tommy's irregular, somewhat impish face, and growl secretly over his
      mental bewilderment. Tommy admired Hamp for his height and breadth and
      dull good-nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      On an afternoon in the early summer the fire-bells rang call after call.
      Engine No. 4 went second. The freight houses by the harbor were burning,
      and the tall furniture factory that backed them. About dusk the north wall
      of the factory fell into the street with a roar and rattle of flying
      bricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book-shop was dark in the centre. The two lamps in the front windows
      were lit, and Mr. Barria's lamp in his hidden corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came upon Mr. Barria in his absorption that there had been a moment
      before the sound of the trampling of heavy feet in the front of the shop,
      and a sudden cry. The trampling continued and increased. He came forward
      with his lamp. Men were crowding up the narrow stairs that began in the
      opposite corner. One of them swung a lantern overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Twere a brick," said some one in the dark centre of the shop. "Took him
      over the ear. Dented him in like a plug hat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's some water?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Knocked her over quicker 'n the brick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sh! What's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the old man."
    </p>
    <p>
      The light of the lamp, lifted in Mr. Barria's hand, fell over his head
      with its flowing white hair, rabbinical beard, and spectral face.
      Three-men, one of them a policeman, drew back to one side of the shop,
      looking startled and feebly embarrassed. On the other side the window lamp
      shone on Janey, where she lay fallen among the old Annuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted her head and muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jhana, Jhana."
    </p>
    <p>
      The three men slipped through the door; those above came down; a doctor
      bustled in, satchel in hand, and after him several women; Janey was
      carried up; the shop was empty, except for Mr. Barria sitting by his lamp
      and muttering softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She could not find it, the peace that is about, and her little happiness
      it would not stay beside her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the doctor spoke over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think Mrs. Durdo should be taken to the hospital. St. James, you know.
      It's not far."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is approaching confinement, and the shock, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever iss desirable, Herr Doctor. There iss no need, sir, of the
      economy in respect to&mdash;to whatever iss desirable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite right, Mr. Barria. Quite right."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was in June. Late in the fall Janey came back from St. James's
      Hospital, pale, drooping, and alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat in a black dress by the front window and kept the accounts as
      before, gazed through the dim panes at Cripple Street, which was made by
      nature to be dull, but read the Annuals no more, which was perhaps a pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barria from the rear of the shop watched Janey, sitting among the
      Annuals and looking out on Cripple Street. He had not entered on the Path
      himself as a cure for sorrow and suffering; he had come to it from another
      direction. Yet the first purpose of its system had been the solution of
      these. It was written:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorrow and suffering will be overcome when this thirst for life is
      quenched, which makes for continuance, and that desire of separateness and
      hunger after selfhood are put aside. They will fall away as drops from a
      lotus leaf."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Janey was a type of them as they walk abroad. The measure of her
      trouble was the measure of the yearning and attainment that had been hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Desire not more then of yearning or attainment, of sight or touch, of
      life in variety or abundance, but desire none at all, and turning within,
      the dwelling you build there dwell in it, until both desire and
      separateness shall in turn disappear."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went forward and drew a chair beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Little Jhana," he said, "there wass once a woman and young who brought
      her dead child to the wisest of men, and asked so of him, 'Do you know one
      medicine that will be good for this child?' It was the custom then for the
      patients or their friends to provide the herbs which the doctors require,
      so that when she asked what herbs he would wish, and he answered,
      'Mustard-seed,' she promised with haste to bring it, for it wass a common
      herb. 'And it must come,' he said, 'only from some house where no child,
      no hussband, no wife, no parent, no friend hass died.' Then she went in
      great hope, carrying the dead child; but everywhere they said, 'I have
      lost,' and again, 'We have lost,' and one said, 'What iss this you say;
      the living are few but the dead are many.' She found so no house in that
      place from which she might take the mustard-seed. Therefore she buried the
      child, and came, and she said, 'I have not found it; they tell me the
      living are few and the dead many.' And he showed her how that nothing
      endured at all, but changed and passed into something else, and each wass
      but a changing part of a changing whole, and how, if one thought more of
      the whole, one so ceased to be troubled much of the parts, and sorrow
      would fade away quietly." Janey stared at him with wide, uncomprehending
      eyes. There was a certain comfort always in Mr. Barria himself, however
      oddly he might talk. She dropped her head on his knee and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know about all that. I want Tommy and the baby."
    </p>
    <p>
      He touched her hair with thin fingers gently. "Then I wonder, little
      Jhana," he said, looking to the magazines and Annuals, "if you have found
      among these one, a poet of the English, who calls it to be better to love
      and lose than not to love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. I don't remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smoothed her hair again and went away. The winter passed and the spring
      came with a scatter of sunshine and little showers. Janey still sat by the
      window. If she had been able to generalize, to see that Tommy and the baby
      represented hunger after life, and that this was the root of sorrow, it
      would perhaps have still seemed to her that love and loss were the better
      choice. Perhaps not. But she could not generalize. Her thoughts were
      instincts, fancies, and little shining points of belief. She could not see
      herself in any figure of speech; that she was one of a multitude of
      discordant notes in the universe, whose business it was to tune themselves
      to the key of a certain large music and disappear in its harmony, where
      alone was constant happiness. It did not seem to mention Tommy or the
      baby, and if not there was no point in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spring slipped away. Cripple Street was filled to the brim with bland
      summer. Janey went every day to the cemetery with flowers. In September
      she began to come back with flowers in her belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a rainy, dismal day in October. Mr. Barria had a remote sense of
      hearing Janey's laugh. It seemed to him there was a strange presence in
      the shop. He peered out, and saw Hamp Sharkey outlined against the window,
      large, slow-moving, and calm, a man who seemed to avoid all troubles of
      the flesh by virtue of having enough flesh, and solid bone beneath. Janey
      looked up at him and laughed. Around her were the old Annuals, containing
      the loves of Edwards and Eleanors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barria leaned back in his chair. Some untraced suggestion led him to
      counting his years idly. He made them out to be nearly eighty. They seemed
      suddenly to rest on his shoulders like a weight. If one considered them at
      all, they were heavy, the years. And for this human life, it was only
      intelligible in the abstract. Of its details there were too many.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shop grew duskier, and the rain beat on the windows with an incessant
      pattering, a multitude of tiny details, sounding accordingly as one might
      listen. For either it would seem a cheerful, busy sound of the kindly
      water, humble and precious and clean, needful in households, pleasant in
      the fulness of rivers, comfortable, common, familiar; or it was the low
      sigh of the driven rain, the melancholy iteration and murmur of water
      circling like everything else its wheel of change, earth and ocean and
      sky, earth and ocean and sky, and weary to go back to its vague, elemental
      vapor, as before the worlds were shaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barria turned back to his volume, bound in gray paper with a German
      imprint. To his ears the sound of the two voices talking became as
      abstract as the rain. Hamp Sharkey's laugh was like the lowing of a
      contented ox, and Janey's, as of old, like the ripple of a brook in a
      meadow.

    <h2>
      TOBIN'S MONUMENT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> was a student
      then and lived on the second floor of a brick dormitory with foot-worn
      stones and sagging casements. The windows looked across one end of the
      campus on ivy-covered walls of other buildings, on a bronze statue whose
      head was bent to indicate that the person represented had taken life
      seriously in his day. Near at hand was a street of unacademic noises,
      horse-cars, shops, German bands, newsboys, people who bought and sold
      without higher mathematics and seldom mentioned Horatius Flaccus.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were drifts and eddies of the street that would turn aside and
      enter the dormitories commercially. Tobin was one of these. He came to my
      door by preference, because of the large crack in the panel. For, if one
      entered the dormitory commercially and knocked at the doors, one never
      knew&mdash;it might be Horatius Flaccus, a volume of size and weight. But
      with a crack in the panel one could stand outside at ease and dignity,
      looking through it, and crying, "<i>M'las ca-andy!</i> Peanuts!" Then, if
      anything arrived, without doubt it arrived. A man might throw what he
      chose at his own door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was thin in the legs and shoulders, but round of face and marked there
      with strange designs that were partly a native complexion; but, if one is
      a candy boy, in constant company with newsboys, shiners, persons who carry
      no such merchandise but are apt to wish for it violently, one's complexion
      of course varies from day to day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, but I hit <i>him!</i> He bled on his clo's." Tobin sometimes made
      this comment, "him" meaning different persons. There was a vein of fresh
      romance in him. Did not Sir Balin, or his like, smite Sir Lanceor, so that
      the blood flowed over his hauberk, and afterward speak of it with
      enthusiasm?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a cold December day in the year 188-, when the snow whirled without
      rest from morning chapel till the end of the day was signified by the
      first splutter of gas-jets. Among the hills where I was born that office
      was left to the sunsets and twilights, who had a manner of doing it, a
      certain broad nobility, a courtesy and grace. "One of God's days is over.
      This is our sister, the night." The gas-jets were fretful, coquettish,
      affected. "It is an outrage! One is simply turned on and turned off!"
      Horatius Flaccus was social and intimate with me that day. "<i>Exegi
      monumentum</i>," he remarked. "You will find it not easy to forget me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Monuments! At the University we lived among commemorative buildings; many
      a silent dusty room was dim with accumulation of thought; and there men
      labored for what but to make a name?
    </p>
    <p>
      The statue outside represented one who took life seriously in his day, now
      with the whirling snow about it, the gas-jet in front snapping petulantly.
      "One is simply turned on and turned off!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Exegi monumentum</i>," continued Horatius Flac-cus. "This is my work,
      and it is good. I shall not all die, <i>non omnis moriar</i>." It seemed
      natural to feel so. But how honorably the sunsets and twilights used to go
      their ways among the hills, contented and leaving not a wrack behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a better attitude and conduct, that serene security of clouds in
      their absolute death. "<i>Non omnis moriar</i>" was not only a boast, but
      a complaint and a protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, as to monuments, one would rather be memorialized by one's own work
      than by the words of other men, or the indifferent labor of their chisels.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>M'las ca-andy!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in, Tobin!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door and said, tentatively, "Peanuts."
    </p>
    <p>
      He always spoke in a more confident tone of the candy than of the peanuts.
      There was no good reason for his confidence in either.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tobin," I said, "you don't want a monument?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He kicked his feet together and murmured again, "Peanuts."
    </p>
    <p>
      His shoes were cracked at the sides. The cracks were full of snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remark seemed to imply that he did not expect a monument, having no
      confidence in his peanuts. As a rule they were soggy and half-baked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tobin's life, I thought, was too full of the flux of things; candy melted,
      peanuts decayed, complexion changed from day to day, his private wars were
      but momentary matters. I understood him to have no artificial desires.
      Death would be too simple an affair for comment. He would think of no
      comment to make. Sunsets and twilights went out in silence; Tobin's half
      of humanity nearly as dumb. It was the other half that was fussy on the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your feet are wet, Tobin. Warm them. Your shoes are no good."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tobin picked the easiest chair with good judgment, and balanced his feet
      over the coals of the open stove, making no comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't buy your peanuts. They're sloppy. I might buy you another pair of
      shoes. What do you think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me, at the shoes, at the wet basket on his knees, but nothing
      elaborate seemed to occur to him. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "A'right." He had great mental directness. I had reached that point in the
      progress of young philosophy where the avoidance of fussiness takes the
      character of a broad doctrine: a certain Doric attitude was desired. Tobin
      seemed to me to have that attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I give you the money, will you buy shoes or cigarettes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shoes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, then. Got anything to say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He put the bill into his pocket, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yep, I'll buy 'em."
    </p>
    <p>
      His attitude was better than mine. The common wish to be thanked was pure
      fussiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, look here. You bring me back the old ones."
    </p>
    <p>
      Even that did not disturb him. The Doric attitude never questions other
      men's indifferent whims.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A'right."
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard him presently on the lower floor, crying, "<i>M'las ca-andy!</i>
      Peanuts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be spoken of," continued Horatius Flaccus, calmly, "by that wild
      southern river, the Aufidus, and in many other places. I shall be called a
      pioneer in my own line, <i>princeps olium carmen deduxisse</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was closing down. The gas-light flickered on the half-hidden
      face of the statue, so that its grave dignity seemed changed to a shifty,
      mocking smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard no more of Tobin for a month, and probably did not think of him.
      There were Christmas holidays about, and that week which is called of the
      Promenade, when one opens Horatius Flaccus only to wonder what might have
      been the color of Lydia's hair, and to introduce comparisons that are
      unfair to Lydia.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late in January. Some one came and thumped on the cracked panel. It
      was not Tobin, but a stout woman carrying Tobin's basket, who said in an
      expressionless voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oi! Them shoes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You give 'im some shoes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tobin. That's so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm Missus Tobin."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was dull-looking, round-eyed, gray-haired. She fumbled in the basket,
      dropped something in wet paper on a chair, and seemed placidly preparing
      to say more. It seemed to me that she had much of Tobin's mental
      directness, the Doric attitude, the neglect of comment. I asked: "How's
      Tobin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oi! He's dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very sorry, Mrs. Tobin. May I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oi! Funeral's this afternoon. He could'n' be round. He was sick. Five
      weeks three days."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went out and down the stair, bumping back and forth between the wall
      and the banister.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the misty afternoon of that day I stood on that corner where more than
      elsewhere the city and the University meet; where hackmen and newsboys
      congregate; where a gray brick hotel looks askance at the pillared and
      vaulted entry of a recitation hall. The front of that hall is a
      vainglorious thing. Those who understand, looking dimly with halfshut
      eyes, may see it change to a mist, and in the mist appear a worn fence, a
      grassless, trodden space, and four tall trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steps of the hall were deserted, except for newsboys playing tag among
      the pillars. I asked one if he knew where Tobin lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's havin' a funeral," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "10 Clark Street."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you know him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The others had gathered around. One of them said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tobin licked him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The first seemed to think more than ordinary justice should be done a
      person with a funeral, and admitted that Tobin had licked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. 10 Clark Street was a door between a clothing shop and a livery
      stable. The stairway led up into darkness. On the third landing a door
      stood open, showing a low room. A painted coffin rested on two chairs.
      Three or four women sat about with their hands on their knees. One of them
      was Mrs. Tobin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Funeral's over," she said, placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman from the mission had come and gone. They were waiting for
      the city undertaker. But they seemed glad of an interruption and looked at
      me with silent interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to ask you to tell me something about him, Mrs. Tobin."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tobin reflected. "There ain't nothin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He never ate no candy," said one of the women, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tobin sat stolidly. Two large tears appeared at length and rolled
      slowly down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It made him dreadful sick when he was little. That's why."
    </p>
    <p>
      The third woman nodded thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He said folks was fools to eat candy. It was his stomach."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oi!" said Mrs. Tobin.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went no nearer the coffin than to see the common grayish pallor of the
      face, and went home in the misty dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The forgotten wet bundle had fallen to the floor and become undone.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the cracks in the sides, the down-trodden heels, the marks of keen
      experience, they were Tobin's old shoes, round-toed, leather-thonged,
      stoical, severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tobin had not commented. She had brought them merely, Tobin having
      stated that they were mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      They remained with me six months, and were known to most men, who came to
      idle or labor, as "Tobin's Monument." They stood on a book-shelf, with
      other monuments thought to be <i>aere perennius</i>, more enduring than
      brass, and disappeared at the end of the year, when the janitor reigned
      supreme. There seemed to be some far-off and final idea in the title, some
      thesis which never got itself rightly stated. Horatius Flaccus was kept on
      the shelf beside them in the notion that the statement should somehow be
      worked out between them. And there was no definite result; but I thought
      he grew more diffident with that companionship.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Exegi monumentum</i>. I suppose there is no doubt about that," he
      would remark. "<i>re perennius</i>. It seems a trifle pushing, so to
      trespass on the attention of posterity. I would rather talk of my Sabine
      farm."

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
